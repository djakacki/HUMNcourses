What is that Robin, what is the matter? Boy. Why this night about two houres ago, there came the young Prince, and three or foure more of his companions, and called for wine good store, and then they sent for a noyse of Musitians, and were very merry for the space of an houre, then whether their Musicke liked them not, or whether they had drunke too much Wine or no, I cannot tell, but our pots flue against the wals, and then they drew their swordes, and went into the streete and fought, and [200]   some tooke one part, & some tooke another, but for the space of halfe an houre, there was such a bloodie fray as passeth, and none coulde part them vntill such time as the Maior and Sheriffe were sent for, and then at the last with much adoo, they tooke them, and so the yong Prince was carried to the Counter, and then about one houre after, there came a Messenger from the Court in all haste from the King, for my Lord Maior and the Sheriffe, but for what cause I know not.
Cobler. Here is newes indeed Robert.
Law. Marry neighbour, this newes is strange indeede, I thinke it best neighbour, to rid our hands of this fellowe first.
Theefe. What meane you to doe with me?
Cobler. We mean to carry you to the prison, and there to remaine till the Sessions day,

[Page ]
Theef. Then I pray you let me go to the prison where my maister is.
Cob.
Nay thou must go to y e country prison, to newgate,
Therefore come away. Theef.
I prethie be good to me honest fellow. Der.
I marry will I, ile be verie charitable to thee,
For I will neuer leaue thee, til I see thee on the Gallowes. Enter Henry the fourth, with the Earle of Exeter, and the Lord of Oxford. Oxf. And please your Maiestie, heere is my Lord Maior and the Sheriffe of London, to speak with your Maiestie.
K. Hen. 4.
[225]   Admit them to our presence. Enter the Maior and the Sheriffe.
Now my good Lord Maior of London, The cause of my sending for you at this time, is to tel you of a matter which I haue learned of my Councell: Herein I vnderstand, that you haue committed my sonne to prison without our leaue and license. What althogh he be a rude youth, and likely to giue occasion, yet you might haue considered that he is a Prince, and my sonne, and not to be halled to prison by euery subiect.
Maior. May it please your Maiestie to giue vs leaue to tell our tale?
King Hen. 4. Or else God forbid, otherwise you might thinke me an vnequall Iudge, hauing more affection to my sonne, then to any rightfull iudgement.
Maior. Then I do not doubt but we shal rather deserue commendations at your Maiesties hands, the any anger.
K. Hen. 4. Go too, say on.
Maior. Then if it please your Maiestie, this night betwixt two and three of the clocke in the morning, my Lord the yong Prince with a very disordred companie, came to the old Tauerne in Eastcheape, and whether it was that their Musicke liked them not, or whether they were ouercome with wine, I know not, but they drew their swords,
[Page ]
and into the streete they went, and some tooke my Lord the yong Princes part, and some tooke the other, but betwixt [250]   them there was such a bloodie fray for the space of halfe an houre, that neither watchme nor any other could stay the, till my brother the Sheriffe of London & I were sent for, and at the last with much adoo we staied them, but it was long first, which was a great disquieting to all your louing subiects thereabouts: and then my good Lord, we knew not whether your grace had sent them to trie vs, whether we would doo iustice, or whether it were of their owne voluntarie will or not, we cannot tell: and therefore in such a case we knew not what to do, but for our own safegard we sent him to ward, where he wanteth nothing that is fit for his grace, and your Maiesties sonne. And thus most humbly beseeching your Maiestie to thinke of our answere.
Hen. 4. Stand aside vntill we haue further deliberated on your answere.
                                         Exit Maior. Hen. 4.
Ah Harry, Harry, now thrice accursed Harry,
That hath gotten a sonne, which with greefe
Will end his fathers dayes.
Oh my sonne, a Prince thou art, I a Prince indeed,
And to deserue imprisonment,
And well haue they done, and like faithfull subiects:
Discharge them and let them go. L. Exe. I beseech your Grace, be good to my Lord the yong Prince.
Hen. 4. Nay, nay, tis no matter, let him alone.
L. Oxf. [275]   Perchance the Maior and the Sheriffe haue bene too precise in this matter.
Hen. 4.
No: they haue done like faithfull subiects:
I will go my selfe to discharge them, and let them go.                                          Exit omnes. Enter Lord chiefe Iustice, Clarke of the Office, Iayler, Iohn Cobler, Dericke, and the Theefe.

Der. Oh maisters stay there, nay lets neuer belie the man, for he hath not beaten and wounded me also, but hee hath beaten and wounded my packe, and hath taken the great rase of Ginger, that bouncing Besse with the iolly buttocks should haue had, that greeues me most.

Hen. 5. Cloake, ilat-holes, needles, and all was of mine [500]   owne deuising, and therefore I wil weare it.

Ioc. Or that euery needle might be a prick to their harts that repine at your doings.
Hen. 5. Thou saist true Iockey, but thers some wil say, the yoong Prince will be a well toward yoong man and all this geare, that I had as leeue they would breake my head with a pot, as to say any such thing, but we stand prating here too long, I must needs speake with my father, therfore come away.

Oh my sonne, my sonne, no sooner out of one prison, but into an other, I had thought once whiles I had liued, to haue seene this noble Realme of England flourish by thee my sonne, but now I see it goes to ruine and decaie.

Uerie ill rule in your Maiesties house. Hen. 4.

Otherwise I can do my father no countenance,
Therefore come away. Oxf.

There should none come. Hen. 5.
Well sirs then be gone,
And prouide me three Noyse of Musitians.                                          Exeunt knights. Enters the Prince with a dagger in his hand. Hen. 4.
Come my sonne, come on a Gods name,
I know wherefore thy comming is,
Oh my sonne, my sonne, what cause hath euer bene,
That thou shouldst forsake me, and follow this vilde and
Reprobate company, which abuseth youth so manifestly:
Oh my sonne, thou knowest that these thy doings
Wil end thy fathers dayes.                                          He weepes. I so, so, my sonne, thou fearest not to approach the presence of thy sick father, in that disguised sort, I tel thee my sonne, that there is neuer a needle in thy cloke, but it is a prick to my heart, & neuer an ilat-hole, but it is a hole to my soule: and wherefore thou bringest that dagger in thy hande I know not, but by coniecture.
                                         He weepes. Hen. 5. My coscience accuseth me, most soueraign Lord, and welbeloued father, to answere first to the last point,
[Page ]
That is, whereas you coniecture that this hand and this [575]   dagger shall be armde against your life: no, know my beloued father, far be the thoughts of your sonne, sonne said I, an vnworthie sonne for so good a father: but farre be the thoughts ofany such pretended mischiefe: and I most humbly render it to your Maiesties hand, and liue my Lord and soueraigne for euer: and with your dagger arme show like vengeance vpon the bodie of that your sonne, I was about say and dare not, ah woe is me therefore, that your wilde slaue, tis not the Crowne that I come for, sweete father, because I am vnworthie, and those vilde & reprobate company I abandon, & vtterly abolish their company for euer. Pardon sweete father, pardon: the least thing and most desire: and this ruffianly cloake, I here teare from my backe, and sacrifice it to the diuel, which is maister of al mischiefe: Pardo me, sweet father, pardon me: good my Lord of Exeter speak for me: pardon me, pardo good father, not a word: ah he wil not speak one word: A Harry, now thrice vnhappie Harry. But what shal I do? I wil go take me into some solitarie place, and there lament my sinfull life, and when I haue done, I wil laie me downe and die.
                                         Exit. Hen. 4.
Call him againe, call my sonne againe. Hen. 5.
And doth my father call me again? now Harry,
Happie be the time that thy father calleth thee againe. Hen. 4.
Stand vp my son, and do not think thy father,
But at the request of thee my sonne, I wil pardon thee,
[600]   And God blesse thee, and make thee his seruant. Hen. 5.
Thanks good my Lord, & no doubt but this day,
Euen this day, I am borne new againe. Hen. 4.

She brought me a dish ofrootes, and a peece of barrel butter

And thou a drab it thou take her part. Iohn.
Hearesta Dericke, is this the matter?
Nay, and it be no worse, we wil go home againe,
And all shall be amended. Der.

Enter the King with his Lords. Hen. 4. Come my Lords, I see it bootes me not to take any phisick, for all the Phisitians in the world cannot cure me, no not one. But good my Lords, remember my last wil and Testament concerning my sonne, for truly my Lordes, I doo not thinke but he wil proue as valiant and victorious a King, as euer raigned in England.
Both. Let heauen and earth be witnesse betweene vs, if we accomplish not thy wil to the vttermost.
Hen. 4.

Enter the Prince. Hen. 5. Ah Harry, thrice vnhappie, that hath neglect so long from visiting of thy sicke father, I wil goe, nay but why doo I not go to the Chamber of my sick father, to comfort the melancholy soule of his bodie, his soule said I, here is his bodie indeed, but his soule is, whereas it needs no bodie. Now thrice accursed Harry, that hath offended thy father so much, and could not I craue pardon for all. Oh my dying father, curst be the day wherin I was borne, and accursed be the houre wherin I was begotten, but what shal I do? if weeping teares which come too late, may suffice the negligence neglected to some, I wil weepe day and night vntil the fountaine be drie with weeping.

Somewhat better after my sleepe,
But good my Lords take off my Crowne,
Remoue my chaire a litle backe, and set me right. Ambo.
And please your grace, the crown is take away. Hen. 4.
The Crowne taken away,
Good my Lord of Oxford, go see who hath done this deed:
No doubt tis some vilde traitor that hath done it,
To depriue my sonne, they that would do it now,
Wonld seeke to scrape and scrawle for it after my death. Enter Lord of Oxford with the Prince. Oxf.
Here and please your Grace,
Is my Lord the yong Prince with the Crowne. Hen. 4.
Why how now my sonne?
I had thought the last time I had you in schooling,
I had giuen you a lesson for all,
And do you now begin againe?
Why tel me my sonne,
[Page ]

Doest thou thinke the time so long,
That thou wouldest haue it before the
Breath be out of my mouth? Hen. 5.
Most soueraign Lord, and welbeloued father,
I came into your Chamber to comfort the melancholy
Soule of your bodie, and finding you at that time
[675]   Past all recouerie, and dead to my thinking,
God is my witnesse: and what should I doo,
But with weeping tears lament y e death of you my father,
And after that, seeing the Crowne, I tooke it:
And tel me my father, who might better take it then I,
After your death? but seeing you liue,
I most humbly render it into your Maiesties hands,
And the happiest man aliue, that my father liue:
And liue my Lord and Father, for euer. Hen. 4.
Stand vp my sonne,
Thine answere hath sounded wel in mine eares,
For I must need confesse that I was in a very sound sleep,
And altogither vnmindful of thy comming:
But come neare my sonne,
And let me put thee in possession whilst I liue,
That none depriue thee of it after my death. Hen. 5.
Well may I take it at your maiesties hands,
But it shal neuer touch my head, so log as my father liues. He taketh the Crowne. Hen. 4.
God giue thee ioy my sonne,
God blesse thee and make thee his seruant,
And send thee a prosperous raigne.
For God knowes my sonne, how hardly I came by it,
And how hardly I haue maintained it. Hen. 5.
Howsoeuer you came by it, I know not,
But now I haue it from you, and from you I wil keepe it:
[700]   And he that seekes to take the Crowne from my head,
Let him looke that his armour be thicker then mine,
Or I will pearce him to the heart,
[Page ]

Were it harder then brasse or bollion. Hen. 4.
Nobly spoken, and like a King.
Now trust me my Lords, I feare not but my sonne
Will be as warlike and victorious a Prince,
As euer raigned in England. L. Ambo.
His former life shewes no lesse. Hen. 4.
wel my lords, I know not whether it be for sleep,
Or drawing neare of drowsie summer of death,
But I am verie much giuen to sleepe,
Therefore good my Lords and my sonne,
Draw the Curtaines, depart my Chamber,
And cause some Musicke to rocke me a sleepe. Exeunt omnes.                                          The King dieth. Enter the Theefe. Theefe.
Ah God, I am now much like to a Bird
Which hath escaped out of the Cage,
For so soone as my Lord chiefe stustice heard
That the old King was dead, he was glad to let me go,
For feare of my Lord the yong Prince:
But here comes some of his companions,
I wil see and I can get any thing of them,
For old acquaintance. Enter Knights raunging. Tom.

Before he come this way:
And hereafter I wil tel the king of thee.                                          Exit Theefe. Ioc.
Oh how it did me good, to see the king
When he was crowned:
Me thought his seate was like the figure of heauen,
And his person like vnto a God. Ned.
But who would haue thought,
That the king would haue changde his countenance so? Ioc.
Did you not see with what grace
He sent his embassage into France? to tel the French king
That Harry of England hath sent for the Crowne,
And Harry of England wil haue it. Tom.
But twas but a litle to make the people b eleeue,
That he was sorie for his fathers death. The Trumpet sounds. Ned.

Lets all stand aside. Enter the King with the Archbishop, and the Lord of Oxford. Ioc.
How do you my Lord? Ned.
How now Harry?
Tut my Lord, put away these dumpes,
You are a king, and all the realme is yours:
What man, do you not remember the old sayings,
You know I must be Lord chiefe Iustice of England,
Trust me my lord, me thinks you are very much changed,
And tis but with a litle sorrowing, to make folkes beleeue
The death of your father greeues you,
And tis nothing so. Hen. 5.
I prethee Ned, mend thy maners,
And be more modester in thy tearmes,
For my vnfeined greefe is not to be ruled by thy flattering
[Page ]

And dissembling talke, thou saist I am changed,
So I am indeed, and so must thou be, and that quickly,
Or else I must cause thee to be chaunged. Ioc.
Gogs wounds how like you this?
Sownds tis not so sweete as Musicke. Tom.
I trust we haue not offended your grace no way. Hen. 5.
Ah Tom, your former life greeues me,
And makes me to abando & abolish your company for euer
And therfore not vpo pain of death to approch my presence
By ten miles space, then if I heare wel of you,
[775]   It may be I wil do somewhat for you,
Otherwise looke for no more fauour at my hands,
Then at any other mans: And therefore be gone,
We haue other matters to talke on.                                          Exeunt Knights.
Now my good Lord Archbishop of Canterbury,
What say you to our Embassage into France? Archb.
Your right to the French Crowne of France,
Came by your great grandmother Izabel,
Wife to King Edward the third,
And sister to Charles the French King:
Now if the French king deny it, as likely inough he wil,
Then must you take your sword in hand,
And conquer the right.
Let the vsurped Frenchman know,
Although your predecessors haue let it passe, you wil not:
For your Country men are willing with purse and men,
To aide you.
Then my good Lord, as it hath bene alwaies knowne,
That Scotland hath bene in league with France,
By a sort of pensions which yearly come from thence,
I thinke it therefore best to conquere Scotland,
And the I think that you may go more easily into France:
And this is all that I can say, My good Lord. Hen. 5.
I thanke you, my good lord Archbishop of Canterbury.
[Page ]

What say you my good Lord of Oxford? Oxf.
[800]   And And please your Maiestie,
I agree to my Lord Archbishop, sauing in this,
He that wil Scotland win, must first with France begin:
According to the old saying.
Therefore my good Lord, I thinke it best first to inuade France,
For in conquering Scotland, you conquer but one,
And conquere France, and conquere both. Enter Lord of Exeter. Exe.
And please your Maiestie,
My Lord Embassador is come out of France. Hen. 5.
Now trust me my Lord,

Commit him to our presence. Enter Duke of Yorke. York.

Now my good Lord the Duke of Yorke,
What newes from our brother the French King? Yorke.

Whereof I tooke some deliberation,
But for the answere he hath sent,
My Lord Embassador of Burges, the Duke of Burgony,
Monsieur le Cole, with two hundred and fiftie horsemen,
To bring the Embassage. Hen. 5.
Commit my Lord Archbishop of Burges
Into our presence. Enter Archbishop of Burges.
[825]   Now my Lord Archbishop of Burges,
We do learne by our Lord Embassador,
That you haue our message to do
From our brother the French King:
Here my good Lord, according to our accustomed order,
We giue you free libertie and license to speake,
[Page ]

With good audience. Archb.
God saue the mightie King of England,
My Lord and maister, the most Christian king,
Charles the seuenth, the great & mightie king of France,
As a most noble and Christian king,
Not minding to shed innocent blood, is rather content
To yeeld somewhat to your vnreasonable demaunds,
That if fiftie thousand crownes a yeare with his daughter
The said Ladie Katheren, in marriage,
And some crownes which he may wel spare,
Not hurting of his kingdome,
He is content to yeeld so far to your vnreasonable desire. Hen. 5.
Why then belike your Lord and maister,
Thinks to puffe me vp with fifty thousand crowns a yere,
No tell thy Lord and maister,
That all the crownes in France shall not serue me,
Except the Crowne and kingdome it selfe:
And perchance hereafter I wil haue his daughter. He deliuereth a Tunne of Tennis balles. Archb.
And it please your Maiestie,
[850]   My Lord Prince Dolphin greets you well,
With this present. He deliuereth a Tunne of Tennis Balles. Hen. 5.
What a guilded Tunne?
I pray you my Lord of Yorke, looke what is in it? Yorke.
And it please your Grace,
Here is a Carpet and a Tunne of Tennis balles. Hen. 5.
A Tunne of Tennis balles?
I pray you good my Lord Archbishop,
What might the meaning thereofbe? Archb.
And it please you my Lord,
A messenger you know, ought to keepe close his message,
And specially an Embassador. Hen. 5.
But I know that you may declare your message
To a king, the law of Armes allowes no lesse.
[Page ]
Archb.
My Lord hearing of your wildnesse before your
Fathers death, sent you this my good Lord,
Meaning that you are more fitter for a Tennis Court
Then a field, and more fitter for a Carpet then the Camp. Hen. 5.
My lord prince Dolphin is very pleansant with me:
But tel him, that in steed of balles of leather,
We wil tosse him balles of brasse and yron,
Yea such balles as neuer were tost in France,
The proudest Tennis Court shall rue it.
I and thou Prince of Burges shall rue it.
Therfore get thee hence, and tel him thy message quickly,
[875]   Least I be there before thee: Away priest, be gone. Archb.
I beseech your grace, to deliuer me your safe
Conduct vnder your broad seale Emanuel. Hen. 5.
Priest of Burges, know,
That the hand and seale of a King, and his word is all one,
And in stead of my hand and seale,
I will bring him my hand and sword:
And tel thy lord & maister, that I Harry of England said it,
And I Harry of England, wil performe it.
My Lord of Yorke, deliuer him our safe conduct,
Under our broad seale Emanuel. Exeunt Archbishop, and the Duke of Yorke.
Now my Lords, to Armes, to Armes,
For I vow by heauen and earth, that the proudest
French man in all France, shall rue the time that euer
These Tennis balles were sent into England.
My Lord, I wil y t there be prouided a great Nauy of ships,
With all speed, at South-Hampton,
For there I meane to ship my men,
For I would be there before him, it it were possible,
Therefore come, but staie,

With this French Embassador.

Until it shall please God to giue me speedie returne
Out of France. Iust.
And if it please your Maiestie, I am far vnworthie
Of so high a dignitie. Hen 5.
Tut my Lord, you are not vnworthie,
Because I thinke you worthie:
For you that would not spare me,
I thinke wil not spare another,
It must needs be so, and therefore come,
Let vs be gone, and get our men in a readinesse.                                          Exeunt omnes. Enter a Captaine, Iohn Cobler and his wife. Cap.

And tro your chance, and lay downe your Drumme. Enter Drummer. Drum.

Hay broth ouer, I wil tel you what

And all to put the fine parel of the English mans in. I. Soul.

I wil tel you what whe haue doune,
We haue bene troing our shance on the Dice,
But none can win the king. Cap.
I thinke so, why he is left behind for me,
And I haue set three or foure chaire-makers a worke,
To make a new disguised chaire to set that womanly
King of England in, that all the people may laugh
And scoffe at him. 2. Soul.
Oh braue Captaine. Cap.
I am glad, and yet with a kinde of pitie
To see the poore king:
Why who euer saw a more flourishing armie in France
In one day, then here is? Are not here all the Peeres of
France? Are not here the Normans with their firie hand-Gunnes,
and slaunching Curtleaxes?
Are not here the Barbarians with their bard horses,
[1150]   And lanching speares?
Are not here Pickardes with their Crosbowes & piercing
Dartes.
[Page ]

The Henues with their cutting Glaues and sharpe
Carbuckles.
Are not here the Lance knights of Burgondie?
And on the other side, a site of poore English scabs?
Why take an English man out of his warme bed
And his stale drinke, but one moneth,
And alas what wil become of him?
But giue the Frenchman a Reddish roote,
And he wil liue with it all the dayes of his life.                                          Exit. 2. Soul. Oh the braue apparel that we shall haue of the English mans.
                                         Exit. Enters the king of England and his Lords. Hen. 5.
Come my Lords and fellowes of armes,
What company is there of the French men? Oxf.
And it please your Maiestie,
Our Captaines haue numbred them,
And so neare as they can iudge,
They are about threescore thousand horsemen,
And fortie thousand footemen. Hen. 5.
They threescore thousand,
And we but two thousand.
They threescore thousand footemen,
And we twelue thousand.
[1175]   They are a hundred thousand,
And we fortie thousand, ten to one:
My Lords and louing Country men,
Though we be fewe and they many,
Feare not, your quarrel is good, and God wil defend you:
Plucke vp your hearts, for this day we shall either haue
A valiant victorie, or a honourable death.
Now my Lords, I wil that my vncle the Duke of Yorke,
Haue the auantgard in the battell.
The Earle of Darby, the Earle of Oxford,
The Earle of Kent, the Earle of Nottingham,
[Page ]

The Earle of Huntington, I wil haue beside the army,
That they may come fresh vpon them.
And I my selfe with the Duke of Bedford,
The Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Gloster,
Wil be in the midst of the battell.
Furthermore, I wil that my Lord of Willowby,
And the Earle of Northumberland,
With their troupes of horsmen, be cotinually running like
Wings on both sides of the army:
My Lord of Northumberland, on the left wing.
Then I wil, that euery archer prouide him a stake of
A tree, and sharpe it at both endes,
And at the first encounter of the horsemen,
To pitch their stakes downe into the ground before them,
[1200]   That they may gore themselues vpon them,
And then to recoyle backe, and shoote wholly altogither,
And so discomfit them. Oxf.
And it please your Maiestie,
I wil take that in charge, if your grace be therwith cotent. Hen.
With all my heart, my good Lord of Oxford:
And go and prouide quickly. Oxf.
I thanke your highnesse.                                          Exit. Hen. 5.
Well my Lords, our battels are ordeined,
And the French making of bonfires, and at their bankets,
But let them looke, for I meane to set vpon them. The Trumpet soundes.
Soft, heres comes some other French message. Enters Herauld. Herald.
King of England, my Lord high Constable,
And other of my Lords, considering the poore estate of thee
And thy poore Countrey men,
Sends me to know what thou wilt giue for thy ransome?
Perhaps thou maist agree better cheape now,
Then when thou art conquered.
[Page ]
Hen. 5.
Why then belike your high Constable,
Sends to know what I wil giue for my ransome?
Now trust me Herald, not so much as a tun of tennis bals
No not so much as one poore tennis ball,
Rather shall my bodie lie dead in the field, to feed crowes,
Then euer England shall pay one penny ransome
For my bodie. Herald.
[1225]   A kingly resolution. Hen. 5.
No Herald, tis a kingly resolution,
And the resolution of a king:
Here take this for thy paines.                                          Exit Herald.
But stay my Lords, what time is it? All.
Prime my Lord. Hen. 5.
Then is it good time no doubt,
For all England praieth for vs:
What my Lords, me thinks you looke cheerfully vpon me?
Why then with one voice and like true English hearts,
With me throw vp your caps, and for England,
Cry S. George, and God and S. George helpe vs. Strike Drummer.                                          Exeunt omnes. The French men crie within, S. Dennis, S. Dennis, Mount Ioy S. Dennis. The Battell. Enter King of England, and his Lords. Hen. 5.
Come my Lords come, by this time our
Swords are almost drunke with French blood,
But my Lords, which of you can tell me how many of our
Army be slaine in the battell? Oxf.
And it please your Maiestie,
There are of the French armie slaine,
Aboue ten thousand, twentie sixe hundred,
Whereof are Princes and Nobles bearing banners:
Besides, all the Nobilitie of France are taken prisoners.
[Page ]

Of your Maiesties Armie, are slaine none but the good
Duke of Yorke, and not aboue fiue or six and twentie
Common souldiers. Hen. 5.
For the good Duke of Yorke my vnckle,
[1250]   I am heartily sorie, and greatly lament his misfortune,
Yet the honourable victorie which the Lord hath giuen vs,
Doth make me much reioyce. But staie,
Here comes another French message.                                          Sound Trumpet. Enters a Herald and kneeleth. Her.
God saue the life of the most mightie Conqueror,
The honourable king of England. Hen. 5.
Now Herald, me thinks the world is changed
With you now, what I am sure it is a great disgrace for a
Herald to kneele to the king of England,
What is thy message? Her.
My Lord & maister, the conquered king of France,
Sends thee long health, with heartie greeting. Hen. 5.
Herald, his greetings are welcome,
But I thanke God for my health:
Well Herald, say on. Herald.
He hath sent me to desire your Maiestie,
To giue him leaue to go into the field to view his poore
Country men, that they may all be honourably buried. Hen. 5.
Why Herald, doth thy Lord and maister
Send to me to burie the dead?
Let him bury them a Gods name.
But I pray thee Herald, where is my Lord hie Constable,
And those that would haue had my ransome? Herald.
And it please your maiestie,
He was slaine in the battell. Hen. 5.
[1275]   Why you may see, you will make your selues
Sure before the victorie be wonne, but Herald,
What Castle is this so neere adioyning to our Campe? Herald.
And it please your Maiestie,
[Page ]

Tis cald the Castle of Agincourt. Hen. 5.
Well then my lords of England,
For the more honour of our English men,
I will that this be for euer cald the battell of Agincourt. Herald.
And it please your Maiestie,
I haue a further message to deliuer to your Maiestie. Hen. 5.
What is that Herald? say on. Her.
And it please your Maiestie, my Lord and maister,
Craues to parley with your Maiestie. Hen. 5.
With a good will, so some of my Nobles
Uiew the place for feare of trecherie and treason. Herald.
Your grace needs not to doubt that.                                          Exit Herald. Hen. 5.
Well, tell him then, I will come.
Now my lords, I will go into the field my selfe,
To view my Country men, and to haue them honourably
Buried, for the French King shall neuer surpasse me in
Curtesie, whiles I am Harry King of England.
Come on my lords.                                          Exeunt omnes. Enters Iohn Cobler, and Robbin Pewterer. Robin.
Now, Iohn Cobler,
Didst thou see how the King did behaue himselfe? Iohn.
But Robin, didst thou see what a pollicie
[1300]   The King had, to see how the French men were kild
With the stakes of the trees. Robin.
I Iohn, there was a braue pollicie. Enters an English souldier, roming. Soul.
What are you my maisters? Both.
Why we be English men. Soul.
Are you English men, then change your language
For the Kings Tents are set a fire,
And all they that speake English will be kild. Iohn.
What shall we do Robin? faith ile shift,
For I can speake broken French.
[Page ]
Robin.
Faith so can I, lets heare how thou canst speak? Iohn.
Commodeuales Monsieur. Robin.
Thats well, come lets be gone. Drum and Trumpet sounds. Enters Dericke roming. After him a Frenchman, and takes him prisoner. Dericke.
O good Mounser. French man.
Come, come, you villeaco. Der.
O I will sir, I will. Frenchman.
Come quickly you pesant. Der.
I will sir, what shall I giue you? French.
Marry thou shalt giue me,
One, to, tre, foure, hundred Crownes. Der.
Nay sir, I will giue you more,
I will giue you as many crowns as wil lie on your sword. French.
Wilt thou giue me as many crowns
As will lie on my sword? Der.
I marrie will I, I but you must lay downe your
[1325]   Sword, or else they will not lie on your sword. Here the Frenchman laies downe his sword, and the clowne takes it vp, and hurles him downe. Der.
Thou villaine, darest thou looke vp? French.
O good Mounsier comparteue.
Monsieur pardon me. Der.
O you villaine, now you lie at my mercie,
Doest thou remember since thou lambst me in thy short el?
O villaine, now I will strike off thy head. Here whiles he turnes his backe, the French man runnes his wayes. Der.
What is he gone, masse I am glad of it,
For if he had staid, I was afraid he wold haue sturd again,
And then I should haue beene spilt,
But I will away, to kill more Frenchmen. Enters King of France, King of England, and attendants.
[Page ]
Hen. 5.
Now my good brother of France,
My comming into this land was not to shead blood,
But for the right of my Countrey, which if you can deny,
I am content peaceably to leaue my siege,
And to depart out of your land. Charles.
What is it you demand,
My louing brother of England? Hen. 5.
My Secretary hath it written, read it. Secretary.
Item, that immediately Henry of England
Be crowned King of France. Charles.
A very hard sentence,
My good brother of England. Hen. 5.
No more but right, my good brother of France. French King.
Well read on. Secret.
[1350]   Item, that after the death of the said Henry,
The Crowne remaine to him and his heires for euer. French King.
Why then you do not onely meane to
Dispossesse me, but also my sonne. Hen. 5.
Why my good brother of France,
You haue had it long inough:
And as for Prince Dolphin,
It skils not though he sit beside the saddle:
Thus I haue set it downe, and thus it shall be. French King.
You are very peremptorie,
My good brother of England. Hen.
And you as peruerse, my good brother of France. Charles.
Why then belike, all that I haue here is yours. Hen. 5.
I euen as far as the kingdom of France reaches Charles.
I for by this hote beginning,
We shall scarce bring it to a calme ending. Hen. 5.
It is as you please, here is my resolution. Charles.
Well my brother of England,
If you will giue me a coppie,
We will meete you againe to morrow.                                          Exit King of France, and all their attendants.
[Page ]
Hen. 5.
With a good will my good brother of France.
Secretary deliuer him a coppie.
My lords of England go before,
And I will follow you.                                          Exeunt Lords. Speakes to himselfe. Hen. 5.
Ah Harry, thrice vnhappie Harry.
[1375]   Hast thou now conquered the French King,
And begins a fresh supply with his daughter,
But with what face canst thou seeke to gaine her loue,
Which hath sought to win her fathers Crowne?
Her fathers Crowne said I, no it is mine owne:
I but I loue her, and must craue her,
Nay I loue her and will haue her. Enters Lady Katheren and her Ladies.
But here she comes:
How now faire Ladie, Katheren of France,
What newes? Kathren.
And it please your Maiestie,
My father sent me to know if you will debate any of these
Unreasonable demands which you require: Hen. 5.
Now trust me Kate,
I commend thy fathers wit greatly in this,
For none in the world could sooner haue made me debate it
If it were possible:
But tell me sweete Kate, canst thou tell how to loue? Kate.
I cannot hate my good Lord,
Therefore far vnfit were it for me to loue. Hen. 5.
Tush Kate, but tell me in plaine termes,
Canst thou loue the King of England?
I cannot do as these Countries do,
That spend halfe their time in woing:
Tush wench, I am none such,
[1400]   But wilt thou go ouer to England? Kate.
I would to God, that I had your Maiestie,
As fast in loue, as you haue my father in warres,
[Page ]

I would not vouchsafe so much as one looke,
Untill you had related all these vnreasonable demands. Hen. 5.
Tush Kate, I know thou wouldst not vse me so
Hardly: But tell me, canst thou loue the king of England? Kate.
How should I loue him, that hath dealt so hardly
With my father. Hen. 5.
But ile deale as easily with thee,
As thy heart can imagine, or tongue can require,
How saist thou, what will it be? Kate.
If I were of my owne direction,
I could giue you answere:
But seeing I stand at my fathers direction,
I must first know his will. Hen. 5.
But shal I haue thy good wil in the mean season? Kate.
Whereas I can put your grace in no assurance,
I would be loth to put you in any dispaire. Hen. 5.
Now before God, it is a sweete wench. She goes aside, and speakes as followeth. Kat.
I may thinke my selfe the happiest in the world,
That is beloued of the mightie King of England. Hen. 5.
Well Kate, are you at hoast with me?
Sweete Kate, tel thy father from me,
That none in the world could sooner haue perswaded me to
[1425]   It then thou, and so tel thy father from me. Kat.
God keepe your Maiestie in good health.                                          Exit. Kat. Hen. 5.
Farwel sweet Kate, in faith, it is a sweet wench,
But if I knew I could not haue her fathers good wil,
I would so rowse the Towers ouer his eares,
That I would make him be glad io bring her me,
Upon his hands and knees.                                          Exit King. Enters Dericke, with his girdle full of shooes. Der.
How now? Sownes it did me good to see how
I did triumph ouer the French men.
[Page ]
Enters Iohn Cobler rouing, with a packe full of apparell. Iohn.
Whoope Dericke, how doest thou? Der.
What Iohn, Comedeuales, aliue yet. Iohn.
I promise thee Dericke, I scapte hardly,
For I was within halfe a mile when one was kild. Der.
Were you so? Iohn.
I trust me, I had like bene slaine. Der.
But once kild, why it tis nothing,
I was foure or fiue times slaine. Iohn.
Foure or fiue times slaine.
Why how couldst thou haue beene aliue now? Der.
O Iohn, neuer say so,
For I was cald the bloodie souldier amongst them all. Iohn.
Why what didst thou? Der.
Why I will tell thee Iohn,
Euery day when I went into the field,
I would take a straw and thrust it into my nose,
[1450]   And make my nose bleed, and then I wold go into the field,
And when the Captaine saw me, he would say,
Peace a bloodie souldier, and bid me stand aside,
Whereof I was glad:
But marke the chance Iohn.
I went and stood behinde a tree, but marke then Iohn.
I thought I had beene safe, but on a sodaine,
There steps to me a lustie tall French man,
Now he drew, and I drew,
Now I lay here, and he lay there,
Now I set this leg before, and turned this backward,
And skipped quite ouer a hedge,
And he saw me no more there that day,
And was not this well done Iohn? Iohn.
Masse Dericke, thou hast a wittie head. Der.
I Iohn, thou maist see, if thou hadst take my cousel,
But what hast thou there?
[Page ]

I thinke thou hast bene robbing the French men. Iohn.
I faith Dericke, I haue gotten some reparrell
To carry home to my wife. Der.
And I haue got some shooes,
For ile tel thee what I did, when they were dead,
I would go take off all their shooes. Iohn.
I but Dericke, how shall we get home? Der.
Nay sownds, and they take thee,
[1475]   They wil hang thee,
O Iohn, neuer do so, if it be thy fortune to be hangd,
Be hangd in thy owne language whatsoeuer thou doest. Iohn.
Why Dericke the warres is done,
We may go home now. Der.
I but you may not go before you aske the king leaue,
But I know a way to go home, and aske the king no leaue. Iohn.
How is that Dericke? Der.
Why Iohn, thou knowest the Duke of Yorkes
Funerall must be carried into England, doest thou not? Iohn.
I that I do. Der.
Why then thou knowest weele go with it. Iohn.
I but Dericke, how shall we do for to meet them? Der.
Sownds if I make not shift to meet them, hang me.
Sirra, thou knowst that in euery Towne there wil
Be ringing, and there wil be cakes and drinke,
Now I wil go to the Clarke and Sexton
And keepe a talking, and say, O this fellow rings well,
And thou shalt go and take a peece of cake, then ile ring,
And thou shalt say, oh this fellow keepes a good stint,
And then I will go drinke to thee all the way:
But I maruel what my dame wil say when we come home,
Because we haue not a French word to cast at a Dog
By the way? Iohn.
Why what shall we do Dericke? Der.
[1500]   Why Iohn, ile go before and call my dame whore,
And thou shalt come after and set fire on the house,
[Page ]

We may do it Iohn, for ile proue it,
Because we be souldiers. The Trumpets sound. Iohn.
Dericke helpe me to carry my shooes and bootes. Enters King of England, Lord of Oxford and Exeter, then the King of France, Prince Dolphin, and the Duke of Burgondie, and attendants. Hen. 5.
Now my good brother of France,
I hope by this time you haue deliberated of your answere? Fr. King.
I my welbeloued brother of England,
We haue viewed it ouer with our learned Councell,
But cannot finde that you should be crowned
King of France. Hen. 5.
What not King of France, then nothing,
I must be King: but my louing brother of France,
I can hardly forget the late iniuries offered me,
When I came last to parley,
The French men had better a raked
The bowels out of their fathers carkasses,
Then to haue fiered my Tentes,
And if I knew thy sonne Prince Dolphin for one,
I would so rowse him, as he was neuer so rowsed. Fr. King.
I dare sweare for my sonnes innocencie
In this matter.
But if this please you, that immediately you be
Proclaimed and crowned heire and Regent of France,
Not King, because I my selfe was once crowned King. Hen. 5.
[1525]   Heire and Regent of France, that is well,
But that is not all that I must haue. Fr. King.
The rest my Secretary hath in writing. Secret.
Item, that Henry King of England,
Be Crowned heire and Regent of France,
During the life of King Charles, and after his death,
[Page ]

The Crowne with all rights, to remaine to King Henry
Of England, and to his heires for euer. Hen. 5.
Well my good brother of France,
There is one thing I must needs desire. Fr. King.
What is that my good brother of England? Hen. 5.
That all your Nobles must be sworne to be true to me. Fr. King.
Whereas they haue not stucke with greater
Matters, I know they wil not sticke with such a trifle,
Begin you my Lord Duke of Burgondie. Hen. 5.
Come my Lord of Burgondie,
Take your oath vpon my sword. Burgon.
I Philip Duke of Burgondie,
Sweare to Henry King of England,
To be true to him, and to become his league-man,
And that if I Philip, heare of any forraigne power
Comming to inuade the said Henry or his heires,
Then I the said Philip to send him word,
And aide him with all the power I can make,
And thereunto I take my oath.                                          He kisseth the sword. Hen. 5.
[1550]   Come Prince Dolphin, you must sweare too.                                          He kisseth the sword. Hen. 5.
Well my brother of France,
There is one thing more I must needs require of you. Fr. King.
Wherein is it that we may satisfie your Maiestie? Hen. 5.
A trifle my good brother of France.
I meane to make your daughter Queene of England,
If she be willing, and you therewith content:
How saist thou Kate, canst thou loue the King of England? Kate.
How should I loue thee, which is my fathers enemy? Hen. 5.
Tut stand not vpon these points,
Tis you must make vs friends:
I know Kate, thou art not a litle proud, that I loue thee:
What wench, the King of England?
[Page ]
French King.
Daughter let nothing stand betwixt the
King of England and thee, agree to it. Kate.
I had best whilst he is willing,
Least when I would, he will not:
I rest at your Maiesties commaund. Hen. 5.
Welcome sweet Kate, but my brother of France,
What say you to it? French king.
With all my heart I like it,
But when shall be your wedding day? Hen. 5.
The first Sunday of the next moneth,
God willing. Sound Trumpets.                                          Exeunt omnes. Back matter
