                     >sisters</persName>, there came in divers of the <placeName type="location"
                     >countrey</placeName> to see him, amongst whom was one plaine countrey <trait

                     <desc>plough-jogger</desc>

                  >Tarlton</persName>'s kin, and so called him <persName type="relative"
                     >cousin</persName>. But <persName type="HistoricalFigure">Tarlton</persName>
                  demanded of his <persName type="relative">father</persName> if it were so. But he
                  knew no such matter. Whereupon, saies <persName type="HisotricalFigure"
                     >Tarlton</persName>, whether he be of my kin or no, I will be cousin to him ere
                  we part, if all the drinke in <placeName type="town">Ilford</placeName> will doe
                  it. So upon this they carouse <state type="feeling">
                     <desc>freely</desc>
                  </state>, and the clowne was then in his cue, so that, in briefe, they were both

                     <desc>soundly</desc>
                  </state>. Night came, and <persName type="HistoricalFigure">Tarlton</persName>
                  would not let his <persName type="relative">cousin</persName> goe, but they would
                  lye together that night, meaning to drinke at their departure next morning.
                     <persName type="HistoricalFigure">Tarlton</persName> would by wit leave him in
                  the lash, since power would not. But see the jest. That night the plaine fellow so
                  .... <persName type="HistoricalFigure">Tarlton</persName> in his bed, thinking he
                  had been against the <objectName type="strucuture">church wall</objectName>, that
                  he was faine to cry for a fresh shirt to shift. him. So, when al was well, they
                  must needs drinke at parting : where, indeed, to seale kindred soundly, the fellow
                  had his loade; for, hearing that his cousin <persName type="HistoricalFigure"
                     >Tarlton</persName> was gone to <placeName type="city">London</placeName>,

                     <desc>Zounds</desc>

                  towards <placeName type="City">London</placeName>, his aime was so good, that he
                  went towards <placeName type="town">Rumford</placeName> to sell his <objectName

               <ab>On Sunday, Tarlton rode to Ilford where his father kept; and dining with them at
                  his sisters, there came in diverse country men to see him, amongst who was one
                  plain country farmer, who said he was Tarlton’s relative who called himself his
                  cousin. But Tarlton demanded the truth from his father if it was true. But he knew
                  no such matter. Whereupon Tarlton says whether he is my relative or not we will be
                  cousins until we part, if we drink in Ilford to do so. So they freely made their
                  way into line so that in briefe they were soundly. Night came and Tarlton would
                  not let his cousin go. But they lied together that night meaning to drink their
                  departure the next morning. Tarlton would by wit leave him in the lash, since
                  power would not. But see the jest. That night, plaine fellow and tarlton in his
                  bed, he had been thinking about the church wall, For we were crying for a fresh
                  shirt. So when he was better they must drink at parting. Indeed to seal the
                  kinfried soundly the fellow had his loade; for, hearing that his cousin Tarlton
                  was gone to london. Angry, he would follow, no one would hold him back. He would
                  go to london, but his aim was so good he went to Rumford to sell his hogs.</ab>

               <ab>Someone asked Tarlton why Monday was called Sunday's friend! Because he is a
                  friend, Tarlton says, to compare with that of the holy day. But it may be that
                  Monday thinks of himself as Sunday's friend, because he follows Sunday, and is the
                  next day after:But he comes a day after the fare for that. Never, says the fellow,
                  but if two Sundays fall together, Monday then may be the first, and it would shew
                  well too. Yes, says Tarlton, But if my nose stood under my mouth it would be
                  better and more profitable. Hoe for my gaim said the fellow? Matty said Tarlton
                  never is cold in the winter, being too close to every dog's tail. The fellow
