               <ab>Once upon a time, Tarlton was wrongfully accused for impregnating a gentleman’s maid and was then brought before a justice in Kent. 
                  The justice said, “It is remarkable that you, M. Tarlton, being a gentleman of good quality, and one of her majesty's servants, would commit
                  to such act.” Tarlton responded, “No, it would be more remarkable if a maid had gotten me with child.”
                  
                  While Tarlton was traveling to play abroad, he stayed in a town with an inn where there was a pretty maid. He placed this woman in a corner of his 
                  affection. Talking with her, they agreed to meet at the bottom of a pair of stairs. The time came, and the maid subtly sent down her mistress, whom 
                  Tarlton caught in his arms. He said “Is the wench coming?” The mistress replied “No.” because she did not know who he was. Tarlton heard it was the 
                  mistress, and stepped aside. The maid came down with a candle, catching a glimpse of Tarlton in the dark, who had just stepped down into another room. 
                  “What happened?” said the maid to the mistress. The mistress replied, “Something scared me. I’m certain I heard some man speak. No, no. It was no man. 
                  I am sure it was a bull caf that I shut into a room until the pounder comes to pound him as a stray. If I had thought he was a man, I would have hit him with 
                  such a knock on his forehead he would never be able to reach his home.” And so, the mistress departed up once again, afraid. How Tarlton took this jest, one can only imagine. 
                  
                  In the country, Tarlton told his hostess he was a conjuror. She said, “Oh sir, I had powder stolen off my shelf the other day. Help me to it, and I will forgive you
                  of all the sixteen pots of ale you owe me.” Tarlton says, “Tomorrow morning the devil shall help you to it, or I will trounce him.” The morning came, and he met the 
                  hostess in a room alone. Tarlton passed time with the exercise of his wit, with circles and tricks, having no more skill than a dog. Contrary to expectation,
                  it fell out as he was calling out. And thus, like a cat, it unexpectedly leapt from the gutter window. This sight amazed Tarlton so much that he skipped ahead 
                  and threw his hostess down, departing with his friends and leaving her hip disjointed. He regarded her in the hands of the surgeon, and did not dare to tell how it happened.
