               <ab>Tarlton was late to Court and when he approached Fleetstreet he saw the police.
                  He did not know how to pass them and he attempted to go by them very fast,
                  thinking that he would go unexamined. However, the police took this action as an
                  act of him completely disregarding their presence and commanded him (in the
                  Queen's name) to stop. Tarlton acted as if he could not stand, he fell to the
                  ground as if he was drunk and so they let him pass because he was intoxicated.

                  without grace, they are uncharitable because they are inside of a shell, and they

               <ab>A Gentleman asked Tarlton what time he thought the Devil to be most active?
                  Tarlton's response was, “When the Pope dies, why?”. The Gentlemen replied by
                  saying that then all of the Devils are active to plague him, because he has done
                  many people wrong who want him to be plagued by the Devil. </ab>
