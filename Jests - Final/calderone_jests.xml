               <ab><persName type="man">TArlton</persName> hauing plaied before <persName type="royalty">the Quéen</persName>, till one a clock at midnight, comming
                  homewards, one of them espied him, calling him, sirra, what art thou? a woman,
                  sayes <persName type="man">Tarlton</persName>: nay that is lie, saith <orgName type="group">the Watchmen</orgName>, women haue no such <objectName type="hair">beards</objectName>:
                  <persName type="man">Tarlton</persName> replied, if I should haue said a man, that you know to be true, and
                  would haue bidden mee tell you that you know not, therefore I sayd a Woman, and
                  so I am all woman, hauing pleased <persName type="royalty">the Quéene</persName>, being a Woman: Well sirra sayes
                  another, I present <persName type="royalty">the Quéene</persName>: then am I a woman indéed saies <persName type="man">Tarlton</persName> as well
                  as you, for you haue a <objectName type="hair">beard</objectName> as well as I, and truly <persName type="woman">Mistris Annis</persName>, my <objectName type="clothing">buske</objectName> is
                  not done yet, when will yours? leaue thy gybing fellow, saith <orgName type="group">the Watch</orgName>; <objectName type="intangible">the
                  Quéens will</objectName> is that whosoeuer is taken without doores after ten a clocke, shall
                  be committed, and now it is past one: commit all such sayes <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName>, for if it
                  be past one a clocke, it will not be ten this eight houres: with that one lifts
                  vp his <objectName type="Lantern">Lanthorne</objectName>, and looks him in the <objectName type="body_part">face</objectName>, and knew him: indéed M. <persName type="man">Tarlton</persName>
                  you haue more <objectName type="light">wit</objectName> then all we, for it is true that ten was before one, but now
                  one is before ten, it is true quoth <persName type="man">Tarlton</persName>, <orgName type="group">Watchmen</orgName> had wont to haue more
                  <objectName type="intangible">wit</objectName>, but for want of sléepe they are turned <trait type="charaterization"><desc>fooles</desc></trait>: so <persName type="man">Tarlton</persName> stole from them,
                  and they to séeme <trait type="characterization"><desc>wise</desc></trait> went home <state type="bed"><desc>to bed</desc></state>.</ab>

               <ab>
                  Tarlton having played before the Queen, until one o’clock, coming home, one of them spotted him as asked “sir, who is there?”. 
                  Tarlton answered by saying “a woman” was there and the Watchmen called him out his lie by reasoning that women do not have beards. 
                  Tarlton replies, explaining that if he had said he said a man, which the watchmen know to be true, they would have reasoned otherwise. 
                  Therefore, I said woman, and so I am all woman, having pleased the Queen by being a woman. 
                  Another watchmen responds by saying “I present the Queen”. Then I am a women indeed, Tarlton says, as well as you, 
                  for you also have a beard and truly Mistris Annis, my buske is not done yet, when will yours be done? Leave the lying fellow, said the Watch. 
                  The Queen’s order is that whoever is taken without doors after ten o’clock, shall be committed, and now it is past one. Commit all, says Tarlton, 
                  for it be past one o’clock, it will not ten this eight hours. One of the watchmen lifts up his lantern, and looks him in the face, and knew him. 
                  Indeed Mr. Tarlton you have more wit then we all do, for it is true that ten was before one, but now one is before ten. 
                  It is true, said Tarlton, Watchmen don’t have more wit, but for want of sleep they are turned into fools. 
                  So, Tarlton stole from them and the watchmen that seemed wise went home to bed.
