               <head><title>How <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName> and One in the <placeName type="playhouse">Gallery</placeName> Fell Out.</title></head>
               <ab>
                  It happened in the middle of a play, when the <orgName type="gathering">audience</orgName> was waiting expectantly for <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName> to appear,
                  he finally came forth.  
                  When he entered, one in the <placeName type="playhouse">gallery</placeName> pointed his <objectName type="body">finger</objectName> 
                  at him and, turning to a <persName type="other">friend</persName> who had never seen <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName>, explained who it was.
                  <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName>, who was eager to make a joke at any opportunity, saw the <persName type="other">man</persName>
                  point with one <objectName type="body">finger</objectName>, and he in turn held up two <objectName type="body">fingers</objectName>.  
                  The <trait type="personality"><desc>captious</desc></trait> man, who was <state type="marital"><desc>married</desc></state> and 
                  <state type="emotion"><desc>jealous</desc></state> of his <persName type="other">wife</persName>, took offense to <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName>’s action, especially because he was a prominent
                  <persName type="performer">player</persName>.  He asked <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName> why he made 
                  <objectName type="body">horns</objectName> at him, and <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName> replied, “No, they are <objectName type="body">fingers</objectName>, for there is no <persName type="other">man</persName> 
                  who will show me a
                  <objectName type="body">finger</objectName> without me returning the gesture.”
                  “No, no,” says the <persName type="other">man</persName>, “you gave me the <objectName type="body">horns</objectName>.”
                  “<state type="verity"><desc>True</desc></state>,” says <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName>, “for my <objectName type="body">fingers</objectName> are tipped with <objectName type="body">nails</objectName>, which are like
                  <objectName type="body">horns</objectName>, and I must make a <objectName type="spectacle">show</objectName> of you.” 
                  The matter grew so that the more the <persName type="other">man</persName> meddled, the more he was disgraced.  The other 
                  <orgName type="gathering">bystanders</orgName> told him to give up and leave 
                  before his cause grew more <state type="desperation"><desc>desperate</desc></state>, so the <persName type="other">man</persName> 
                  pulled his <objectName type="clothing">hat</objectName> over his <objectName type="body">eyes</objectName> and left.

               <ab>
               It happened that one <persName type="performers">Fancy and Nancy</persName>, a group of <orgName type="troupe">musicians</orgName> in 
                  <placeName type="city">London</placeName>, would come with their <orgName type="friendGroup">friends</orgName> to visit 
                  <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName>, 
               who was one of their <trait type="age"><desc>oldest</desc></trait> <orgName type="friendGroup">friends</orgName> and 
                  <orgName type="monetary">benefactors</orgName>.  At this time, <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName> lived at a 
                  <placeName type="tavern">tavern</placeName> on <placeName type="street">Gracious Street</placeName> called the 
                  <placeName type="tavern">Saba</placeName>,
               and the <orgName type="troupe">musicians</orgName> came by one summer morning to play a <objectName type="music">song</objectName> and
                  wake up <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName>.  In recognition of their <objectName type="abstract">efforts</objectName>, <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName> opened his 
               <objectName type="furniture">bedroom door</objectName> and gave them <objectName type="food">muscadine</objectName>.  
                  A <persName type="other">thief</persName> watched this and noticed that <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName> had left his
                  <placeName type="room">room</placeName> in his <objectName type="clothing">shirt</objectName> and 
                  <objectName type="clothing">nightgown</objectName> to 
               drink with his <orgName type="friendGroup">friends</orgName>.  The <persName type="other">thief</persName> stepped into 
                  <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName>’s <placeName type="room">room</placeName> and took his 
                  <objectName type="clothing">clothes</objectName>, thinking that if he were caught, he would make 
               his actions into a <objectName type="entertainment">jest</objectName>, but no one saw him and he went on his way.  
                  Shortly afterwards, <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName> returned to his <placeName type="room">room</placeName> and looked 
               for his <objectName type="clothing">clothes</objectName>, but he could not find them.  The next day, news of this story was spreading, 
                  and <persName type="other">someone</persName> in the <orgName type="gathering">crowd</orgName> mocked 
                  <persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName> while he was performing at the <placeName type="playhouse">Curtain</placeName>, saying, 
               </ab>
                  <lg>
                     <l><persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName> I will tell you a <objectName type="entertainment">jest</objectName>,</l>
                     <l>Which after turned to <state type="honesty"><desc>earnest</desc></state>:</l>
                     <l>One there was as I heard say,</l>
                     <l>Who in his <objectName type="clothing">shirt</objectName> heard <objectName type="entertainment">music</objectName> play,</l>
                     <l>While all his <objectName type="clothing">clothes</objectName> were <state type="ownership"><desc>stolen</desc></state> away.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <ab><persName type="Tarlton">Tarlton</persName> smiled and replied by saying,</ab>
                  <lg>
                     <l>That's certain, <persName type="other">Sir</persName>, it is no lie,</l>
                     <l>That same one in truth was I:</l>
                     <l>When that the <persName type="other">thief</persName> shall pine and lack,</l>
                     <l>Then shall I have <objectName type="clothing">clothes</objectName> to my <objectName type="body">back</objectName>:</l>
                     <l>And I together with my <orgName type="friendGroup">fellows</orgName>,</l>
                     <l>May see him ride to <placeName type="penal">Tiburne Gallows</placeName>.</l>
