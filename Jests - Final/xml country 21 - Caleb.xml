               <ab>Tarlton rode along with friends, and citizens to make merry to Waltham. On the
                  way he met his hostess while riding toward London, to which some of his old
                  acquaintances were saluted. The Hostess where Tarlton was going. Tarlton told her
                  to come to Waltham, and requested company Christopher Marlowe’s house. Tarlton do
                  not go and spend your money, not unless we go back to the hound. She lost their
                  customs, and was sent back to London by her man who was sent to go back with them.
                  She was an exceeding and very honest woman, and would do anything, which Tarlton
                  heard as wise as she was, thinking of her mind. He was deceived, yet he asked her
                  if the biggest bed in her house was able to fit them. Meaning himself and her, yes
                  she says and tumble up down at pleasure. Yea one under another says Tarlton, under
                  she says. She agreed to everything like a subtil hostess, and it fell out so that
                  Tarlton, having her in a room in her house, asked her which of those two beds were
                  big enough for them two. This being said she therefore went to be, sweetheart come
                  to thee. Masse says Tarlton my boots were off, I would indeed. I will help you sir
                  , if you please. Yeah, thought Tarlton is the wind in that door? Come on, then.
                  And she very diligently began to pull, til one boot was half off. Now says she,
                  this being hard to be done, let me try cunning on the other and so get both off.
                  But, having both off his legs she left him at the shoemakers. She then went to
                  london where Tarlton was three hours way, and he had no help. But being eased off
                  his pain, he made this rhyme for a theme. Singing it all the way to London. Women
                  are wanton, and hold it no sinne, By tricks and devices to pull a man in. </ab>
               <ab>Tarlton rode with a group of friends, and citizens to go to Waltham, courtesy of
                  his Hostess while riding toward London.</ab>
