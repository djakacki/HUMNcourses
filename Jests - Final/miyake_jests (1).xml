               <ab>There was a man named Bankes (in the time of <persName type="tarleton">

               <head><title>An excellent Jest of <persName type="tarleton">Tarleton</persName> suddenly spoken.</title></head>
               <ab>At the <placeName type="playhouse">Bull</placeName> at <placeName type="street">Bishops-gate</placeName>, there was a play of <name type="play">Henry the fifth</name>
                  , where the <persName type="play-character">Judge</persName> was to take a box on the <objectName type="body-part">ear</objectName>. Because the <persName type="play-character">Judge</persName> that should take the blow was
                  <state type="existence"><desc>absent</desc></state>, <persName type="tarleton">Tarlton</persName> himself (ever forward to please) took upon him to to play the
                  same <persName type="play-character">Judge</persName>, besides his own part of the <persName type="play-character">Clown</persName>. <persName type="actor">Knell</persName>, who plays <persName type="play-character">Henry the Fifth</persName>,
                  punched  <persName type="tarleton">Tarlton</persName> with a great sound, which made the <orgName type="audiences">people</orgName> <state type="emotion"><desc>laugh</desc></state> because it was
                  <persName type="tarleton">Tarlton</persName> who plays the <persName type="play-character">Judge</persName>. Immediately after the <persName type="play-character">Judge</persName> disappears, <persName type="tarleton">Tarlton</persName> (in
                  his <persName type="play-character">Clown</persName> <objectName type="clothing">clothes</objectName>) comes out, and asks the <orgName type="actors">Actors</orgName> "What news? O says one, have you
                  been here, you should have seen <persName type="play-character">Price Henry</persName> hit the <persName type="play-character">Judge</persName> with a terrible punch on
                  the <objectName type="body-part">ear</objectName>. "What man", said <persName type="tarleton">Tarlton</persName>, "strike a <persName type="play-character">Judge?</persName>". "It is true with faith",
                  said the other. "No one is like that ", said <persName type="play-character">Judge</persName>, " and it must be <state type="terrible"><desc>terrible</desc></state>
                  to the <persName type="play-character">Judge</persName> because the report <state type="emotion"><desc>terrifies</desc></state> me, making me think that the blow
                  remains still on my cheek and it burns again." The <orgName type="audiences">people</orgName> <state type="emotion"><desc>laughed</desc></state> at this
                  enormously, and to this day I have heard this story being praised for the
                  uniqueness. However, it was not rare for <persName type="tarleton">Tarlton</persName> as he had many similar story of
                  these. I would like to see our <persName type="play-character">Clowns</persName> in these days to do the similar things like
                  this, and I bet they cannot do better than <persName type="tarleton">Tarlton</persName>, even though these <persName type="play-character">clowns</persName>
                  think they can do a <trait type="talent"><desc>good job</desc></trait>.</ab>
