               <ab>In the city of <placeName>Norwich</placeName>, <persName>Tarlton</persName> was on a time invited to an hunting, where
                  there was a goodly <persName>gentlewoman</persName>, that bravely mounted on a<trait><desc type="apperance"> blacke</desc></trait> <objectName type="animal">horse</objectName>, rode
                  exceeding well, to the wonder of all the beholders ; and neither hedge nor
                  ditch stood in her way, but <objectName type=" animal">Pegasus</objectName>, her <objectName>horse</objectName>, for so may we tearme him for
                  swiftnesse, flew over all, and she sate him as well. When every one returned
                  <placeName>home</placeName>, some at <placeName>supper</placeName> commended hie hound, others his <state><desc>hawke</desc></state> and shee above all,
                  her horse. And, said she, I love no living creature so well, at this instant,
                  as my <trait><desc>gallant</desc></trait> <objectName type="animal">horse</objectName>. Yes, <persName>lady</persName>, a man better, saies <persName>Tarlton</persName>. Indeed no, said
                  shee, not now ; for since my last <persName>husband</persName> dyed I <state><desc>hate</desc></state> them most, unlesse you
                  can give me medicines to make me <state><desc type="feeling">love</desc></state> them. <persName>Tarlton</persName> made this jest instantly

                  <l>Why, a <objectName type="animal">horse</objectName> mingeth whay, madam, a man mingeth amber,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>That a <objectName type="animal">horse</objectName> is my chiefe opinion now, I deny not,</l>

               <ab>But till then give me leave to <state><desc type="feeling">love</desc></state> something. Then something will please you,
                  said <persName>Tarlton</persName>, I am <state><desc type="feeling">glad</desc></state> of that, therefore I pray God send you a good thing or

               <ab>In the city of <placeName>Norwich</placeName>, <persName>Tarlton</persName> was invited to hunt. There was a<trait><desc> godly</desc></trait> <persName>gentlewoman</persName>, that bravely mounted on a <trait><desc>black</desc></trait> <objectName>horse</objectName>, rode exceedingly well, 
                  to the wonder of all the people; and no one stood in her way. But, <objectName type="animal">Pegasus</objectName>, her <objectName>horse</objectName>, was swift and flew over all. Everyone went home and at dinner everyone comended his pester and his wild disposition and she above all her <objectName type="horse">horse</objectName>. And, she said, I love no creature so much, at this moment, my<trait><desc> gallant</desc></trait> <objectName>horse</objectName>. 
                  Yes, lady, a man better, says <persName>Tarlton</persName>. Indeed no, she said, not now, since my last <persName>husband</persName> died I hate them the most, unless you can give me medicines to make me love them. 
                 <persName> Tarlton</persName> made this jest instant. Why, a <objectName type="animal">horse</objectName> goes that way, madam, a man mimics amber. A <objectName type="animal">horse</objectName> is for your way madam, but a <persName>man</persName> for your <placeName>chamber</placeName>. 
                  Lord have mercy, <persName>Tarlton</persName>, said the <persName>men</persName>: which <persName>gentlewoman</persName> is noting, seeing they took exceptions at her words, to make all well, answered this:
                  That a <objectName type="animal">horse</objectName> is my opinion now, I deny not, And when a <persName>man</persName> does more good in my <placeName>chamber</placeName> I do not defy him.
                  But until then give me room to love something. Then I will please you, said <persName>Tarlton</persName>. I am glad of that, therefore I pray God send you a good thing or none at all.

                  things : now many <persName>gallants</persName> at supper noted one <persName>woman</persName>, who being <state><desc type="apperance">little</desc></state> and
                  <state><desc type="apperance">pretty</desc></state>, to unfit her prettinesse had a great <trait><desc type="apperance">wide</desc></trait> mouth, which she seeming to
                  hide, would pinch in her speeches, and speake small, but .was desirous to heare
                  newes. <persName>Tarlton</persName> told at his comming from <placeName>London</placeName> to <placeName>Norwich</placeName>, a proclamation was
                  made that every man should have two <persName>wives</persName>. Now <persName>Jesus</persName>, qd. she, is it possible?
                  Ay gentlewoman, and otherwise able too, for contrarily <persName>women</persName> have a larger
                  <state><desc>preeminence</desc></state>, for every <persName>woman</persName> must have three husbands. Now <persName>Jawsus</persName>, said the

                  the table <state><desc>smil'd</desc></state> at ; which she <state><desc>perceiving</desc></state>, would answere no more. Now <persName>mistris</persName>,
                  said <persName>Tarlton</persName>, your mouth is lease than ever it was, for now it is able to say
                  nothing. Thou art a cogging knave, said she. <persName>Masse</persName>, and that is something, yet,
                  said <persName>Tarlton</persName>, your <objectName>mouth</objectName> shall be as <trait><desc type="apperance">wide</desc></trait> as ever it was for that jest.</ab>

But her prettiness had a wide mouth, which she tried to hide. 
                  She would pinch her speech, and speak small, but had a desire to hear news. <persName>Tarlton</persName> told that his travelling from <placeName>London</placeName> to <placeName>Norwich</placeName>, was a proclamation that was made that every man
                  should have two <persName>wives</persName>. Now <persName>Jesus</persName> questioned her, is it possible? <persName>Gentelwoman</persName> and otherwise able to or contrarily <persName>woman</persName> have a large superrority, for every <persName>woman</persName> must have three <persName>husbands</persName>. 
                  Now <persName>Jesus</persName>, said the <persName>gentlewoman</persName> and with wonder skews the full <trait><desc type="apperance">wideness</desc></trait> of her mouth, which all the table smiled at, which she realized would answer no more. Now miss, said <persName>Tarlton</persName>, your mouth is less than it ever was, for now you are able to say nothing. 
                  Now arent you a <trait><desc>dishonest</desc></trait> <persName>man</persName>, she said. Miss and that is something, yet, said <persName>Tarlton</persName>, your mouth shall be as wide as it ever was for that jest. </ab>
