                  not: whereat <persName type="main_character">Tarlton</persName> as mad <state><desc>angry</desc></state>, as he was mad <state><desc>drunke</desc></state>, claps me on his <objectName type="body_part">legs</objectName> a
                  huge payre of <objectName type="material">boults</objectName>: the fellow dead <state><desc>asléep</desc></state> felt nothing: when all was done,

                  God good seruice, and let him lie there till he waked. While they were about
                  their sport the fellow waked, and finding himselfe <state><desc>in durance</desc></state>, and the <objectName>Iayle</objectName>
                  hung round with <objectName type="tool">bolts</objectName> and <objectName type="tool">shakels</objectName>, he began to blesse himselfe, and thought
                  sure in his <state><desc>drunkennes</desc></state> he had done some mischiefe: with that he called to know,
                  but none came to him, then he thought verely his fault was capitall, and that
                  hee was close prisoner: by and by comes the <persName>Kéeper</persName>, and moaned him, that one so
                  yong should come to so shamefull a death as hanging: anone, another comes, and
                  another with the like, which further put him in a <state><desc>puzzle</desc></state>: but at last comes
                  <persName type="main_character">Tarlton</persName> and others, intreating the <persName>Kéeper</persName>, yet if it might be, that they might
                  sée their fellow ere they went, but hee very hardly was intreated, but at
                  length the poore <trait><desc>drunken</desc></trait> Signior cal'd out for them: in they come. Oh <persName>Tom</persName>,
                  sayes <persName>Tarlton</persName>, hard was thy hap in <state><desc>drunkennesse</desc></state> to murder this <trait><desc>honest</desc></trait> man, and
                  our <trait><desc>hard</desc></trait> hap too, to haue it reported any of our company is hangd for it. O
                  <persName>God</persName>, O <persName>God</persName> saies the fellow, is my fault so great? then commend me to all my
                  friends. Well, short tale to make, the fellow forswore <state><desc>drunkennesse</desc></state> if he could
                  escape, and by as cunning a wile to his thinking, they got him out of <placeName type="housing">prison</placeName> by
                  an escape, and sent him to <placeName type="city">London</placeName> before, who was not a litle glad he was <state><desc>gone</desc></state>:
                  but sée how this Iest wrought, by little and little the fellow left his
                  excessiue drinking, and in timealtered his desire of <state><desc>drunkennesse</desc></state>.</ab>

                  At Salisbury, Tarlton and his partners were going to preform for the Major and his accompanies, however one of Tarlton’s partners got so drunk that he could not preform. Tartlon got angry because he got drunk, so he put chained up his drunk friend. He was so drunk that he did not understand what was going on. Tarlton put his drunk friend in a fake prison and once he woke up he was scared and afriad. Once Tarlton and his friends revealed themselves he made his friend swear to never get that drunk again

He could have cut off Tarlton’s head, however Tarlton told the man that someone would come up and fight him if he attempted to do so. Not being in the best interest of the man, he left Tarlton. </ab>
