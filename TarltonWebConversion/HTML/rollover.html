   <body>To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in
      				Congress Assembled:
      <p>The undersigned, Citisens of the United States, believing that under the present
         					Federal Constitution all women who are citisens of the United States have the
         					right to vote, pray your Honorable Body to
         				enact a law during the present session that shall assist and protect them in the
         exercise of that
         					right
         			</p>
      <p>And they pray further that they may be permitted in person, and in behalf of the
         				thousands of other women who are petitioning Congress to the same effect to be
         heard
         				upon this Memmoiral before the Senate and House at an early day in the present
         				Session.</p>
      <p>We ask your Honorable Body to bear in mind that while men are represented on the
         				floor of Congress and so may be said to be heard there, women
         				who are allowed no vote and therefore no representation cannot truly be heard
         except
         				as Congress shall open its doors to us in person.</p>Elizabeth Cady

      				Olympia Brown 
      				Susan B. Anthony 
      				Josephine S. Griffing 
      				Hartford Conn. Dec. 1871</body>
