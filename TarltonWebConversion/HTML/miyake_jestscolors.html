      the <font xmlns="" color="orange">horse</font> by to giue ayme: but euer after it was a by-word through 
      <font xmlns="" color="green">London</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">God</font> a <font xmlns="" color="orange">mercy horse</font>, 
      and is to this day.Tarlton greeting with <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bankes</font>'s horse.There was a man named Bankes (in the time of <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> ) 
      who served the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Earle of Essex</font>
      and had a <font xmlns="" color="orange">horse</font> of strange qualities. Being at the <font xmlns="" color="green">Crosse-keyes</font> in
      <font xmlns="" color="green">Gracious stréete</font>, Bankes earned <font xmlns="" color="orange">money</font>
      with him (as he was mightily resorted to) <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> then 
      (with his fellowes) playing at the <font xmlns="" color="green">Bell</font> came into the
      <font xmlns="" color="green">Crosse-keyes</font> amongst many <font xmlns="" color="yellow">people</font> to see fashions.
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bankes</font> perceiving (to make the people laugh) sayes "Signior (to his <font xmlns="" color="orange">Horse</font>) go fetch me the most
      fool in this <font xmlns="" color="yellow">group of people</font>". the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Jade</font> comes immediatly, and with his mouth drawes
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> forth: <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> with merry words said nothing, but "<font xmlns="" color="blue">God</font> a <font xmlns="" color="orange">mercy Horse</font>". In
      the end, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> sees the <font xmlns="" color="yellow">people</font>laugh, and was angry inwardly, said, "Sir,
      if I have the power to use your <font xmlns="" color="orange">horse</font>, I would do more then that." <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bankes</font> (to please him) said
      "I will charge him to do it". then <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> says, "charge him to bring me the most 
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">whore-master</font> in this <font xmlns="" color="yellow">group of people</font>".
      The horse says something to <font xmlns="" color="blue">Bankes</font>. "Signior saies he will bring <font xmlns="" color="blue">Mr. Tarlton</font> here the veriest
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Whoremaster</font> in this <font xmlns="" color="yellow">group</font>". Instead, <font xmlns="" color="orange">Horse</font> 
      leads his <font xmlns="" color="blue">master</font> to him. Then, <font xmlns="" color="blue">God</font> a <font xmlns="" color="orange">mercy Horse</font> 
      indeed, says <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font>. The <font xmlns="" color="yellow">people</font> tried hard to keep 
      peace, but <font xmlns="" color="yellow">Bancks and Tarlton</font> had like to quarrel about where 
      the <font xmlns="" color="orange">horse</font> targets at. Ever after it became a story through 
      <font xmlns="" color="green">London</font>, <font xmlns="" color="blue">God</font> a <font xmlns="" color="orange">mercy horse</font>, 
      and is to this day.

      <h5 xmlns="">Edited by: <font color="blue">Tsugu Miyake</font></h5><br xmlns=""></br><h3 xmlns="" align="left">An excellent Iest of <font color="blue">Tarlton</font> suddenly spoken.</h3>AT the <font xmlns="" color="green">Bull</font> at <font xmlns="" color="green">Bishops-gate</font> 
      was a play of Henry the fift, wherein the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Iudge</font>
      was to take a boxe on the <font xmlns="" color="orange">eare</font>, and because he was absent that should take the
      blow: <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> himselfe (euer forward to please) tooke upon him to play the same
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Iudge</font>, besides his owne part of the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Clowne</font>: 
      and <font xmlns="" color="blue">Knell</font> then playing <font xmlns="" color="blue">Henry the fift</font>, hit 
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> a sound boxe indéed, which made the <font xmlns="" color="yellow">people</font>laugh the more, because it was he: but anone the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Iudge</font> 
      goes in, &amp; immediatly <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> (in his <font xmlns="" color="blue">Clownes</font><font xmlns="" color="orange">clothes</font>) comes out, 
      and askes the <font xmlns="" color="yellow">Actors</font> what newes? O saith one,
      hadst thou béene here, thou shouldst haue séene <font xmlns="" color="blue">Prince Henry</font> hit the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Iudge</font> a
      terribly▪ boxe on the eare: What man, said <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font>, strike a <font xmlns="" color="blue">Iudge</font>? It is true
      y faith, said the other: no other like, said <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font>, and it could not be but
      terrible to the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Iudge</font>, when the report so terrifies me, that me thinkes the
      blow remaines still on my chéeke, that it burnes againe. The <font xmlns="" color="yellow">people</font>laught at
      this mightily, and to this day I haue heard it commended for rare: but no
      maruaile, for he had many of these. But I would sée our <font xmlns="" color="blue">Clownes</font> in these dayes
      doe the like, no I warrant ye, and yet they thinke <font xmlns="" color="pink">well</font> of themselues too.An excellent Jest of Tarleton suddenly spoken.At the <font xmlns="" color="green">Bull</font> at <font xmlns="" color="green">Bishops-gate</font>, there was a play of Henry the fifth
      , where the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Judge</font> was to take a box on the <font xmlns="" color="orange">ear</font>. Because the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Judge</font> that should take the blow was
      absent, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> himself (ever forward to please) took upon him to to play the
      same <font xmlns="" color="blue">Judge</font>, besides his own part of the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Clown</font>. <font xmlns="" color="blue">Knell</font>, who plays <font xmlns="" color="blue">Henry the Fifth</font>,
      punched  <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> with a great sound, which made the <font xmlns="" color="yellow">people</font> laugh because it was
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> who plays the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Judge</font>. Immediately after the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Judge</font> disappears, <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> (in
      his <font xmlns="" color="blue">Clown</font><font xmlns="" color="orange">clothes</font>) comes out, and asks the <font xmlns="" color="yellow">Actors</font> "What news? O says one, have you
      been here, you should have seen <font xmlns="" color="blue">Price Henry</font> hit the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Judge</font> with a terrible punch on
      the <font xmlns="" color="orange">ear</font>. "What man", said <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font>, "strike a <font xmlns="" color="blue">Judge?</font>". "It is true with faith",
      said the other. "No one is like that ", said <font xmlns="" color="blue">Judge</font>, " and it must be terrible
      to the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Judge</font> because the report terrifies me, making me think that the blow
      remains still on my cheek and it burns again." The <font xmlns="" color="yellow">people</font> laughed at this
      enormously, and to this day I have heard this story being praised for the
      uniqueness. However, it was not rare for <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> as he had many similar story of
      these.  I would like to see our <font xmlns="" color="blue">Clowns</font> in these days to do the similar things like
      this,  and I bet they cannot do better than <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font>, even though these <font xmlns="" color="blue">clowns</font>
      think they can do a <font xmlns="" color="pink">good job</font>.
