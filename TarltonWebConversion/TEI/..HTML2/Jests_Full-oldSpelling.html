      <span xmlns="" class="hovertext" data-hover="body_part">tongue</span>, of which he would brag

      Lend me a <span xmlns="" class="hovertext" data-hover="monarchy">French crowne</span>, saies the

      see that. Meane time she tooke up the <span xmlns="" class="hovertext" data-hover="commodity">
         sixe-pence</span>, and willed him to let them see the <span xmlns="" class="hovertext" data-hover="commodity">money</span> againe ; when he did see it it was a
      counter, and he made this rime :-
      <p xmlns="">Alas, alas, how came all this to passe !</p>

      was on a time invited to an hunting, where there was a goodly gentlewoman, that
      bravely mounted on a blacke<span xmlns="" class="hovertext" data-hover="animal">horse</span>, rode exceeding well, to the
      wonder of all the beholders ; and neither hedge nor ditch stood in her way, but
      <span xmlns="" class="hovertext" data-hover=" animal">Pegasus</span>, her
      horse, for so may we tearme him for swiftnesse,
      flew over all, and she sate him as well. When every one returned
      home, some at supper commended
      hie hound, others his hawke and shee above all, her horse. And, said she, I love no living
      creature so well, at this instant, as my gallant<span xmlns="" class="hovertext" data-hover="animal">horse</span>. Yes, lady, a
      man better, saies Tarlton. Indeed no, said shee, not now ;
      for since my last husband dyed I hate them most, unlesse you can give me medicines to make me love them. Tarlton made this jest instantly :-
      <p xmlns="">Why, a <span class="hovertext" data-hover="animal">horse</span> mingeth whay, madam, a
         man mingeth amber,</p>
      <p xmlns="">A horse is for your way, madam, but a man for your

      <p xmlns="">And when a man doth me more good in my chamber I him defie not.</p>But till then give me leave to love something. Then something will please you, said
      Tarlton, I am glad of that, therefore I pray God send you a good thing or none at
      all.

      tell you strange things : now many gallants at supper
      noted one woman, who being little and pretty, to unfit her prettinesse had a great wide mouth, which she seeming to hide, would pinch in her speeches, and
      speake small, but .was desirous to heare newes. Tarlton
      told at his comming from London to
      Norwich, a proclamation was made that every man
      should have two wives. Now Jesus, qd.
      she, is it possible? Ay gentlewoman, and otherwise able too, for contrarily
      women have a larger preeminence, for every woman must have three husbands. Now
      Jawsus, said the gentlewoman, and with wonder shewes the full widenesse of her mouth, which all the table smil'd at ; which she perceiving, would answere no more. Now mistris, said
      Tarlton, your mouth is lease than ever it was, for now
      it is able to say nothing. Thou art a cogging knave, said she.
      Masse, and that is something, yet, said
      Tarlton, your mouth shall be
      as wide as ever it was for that jest.

      Edmondsbury, in Suffolk, that died but of late daies, one M. Blague, by name, and a
      good kinde justice, too, carefull for the poore : this justice met with Tarlton in
      Norwich ; Tarlton, said he, give
      me thy hand. But you, sir, being richer, may give me a greater gift, give me your body, and embracing him,
      could not halfe compasse him. Being merry in talke, said the justice, <span xmlns="" class="hovertext" data-hover="Tarlton">Tarlton</span>, tell me one thing, what
      is the difference betwixt a <span xmlns="" class="hovertext" data-hover="flea">flea</span> and a

      Tarlton, as much and like difference as twixt you and

      though butchers are over you, ready to knock you on the head. Thou art a knave,
      quoth the justice. I, sir, I knew that, ere I came hither, else I had not been
      here now, for ever one knave, making a stop, seekes out another. The justice,
      understanding him, laughed heartily.
