               <head><title>How Tarlton deceiued an Inne-holder at Sandwich.</title></head>
               <ab>VPon a time when the Plaiers were put to silence, Tarlton and his boy frolickt
                  so long in the Country, that all their money was gone, and being a great way
                  from London, they knew not what to doe; but as want is the whetstone of wit,
                  Tarlton gathereth his conceit together, and practised a tricke to beare him vp
                  to London without money, &amp; thus it was: Vnto an Inne in Sandwich they went,
                  and there lay for two daies at great charge, although he had no money to pay
                  for the same: the third morning he bad his man go downe and male-content
                  himselfe before his Hoast and his Hoastesse, &amp; mumbling say to himselfe,
                  Lord▪ Lord, what a scalde master doe I serue, this it is to serue such Seminary
                  Priests and Iesuits, now euen as I am an honest boy, Ile leaue him in the
                  lurch, and shift for my selfe: here's a doe about penance and mortification, as
                  though (forsooth) Christ hath not died enough for all: The boy mumbled out
                  these his instructions so dissembling, that it strooke a iealousie in the
                  Inne-holders heart, that out of doubt his master was a Seminary Priest;
                  whereupon he presently sent for the Constable, and told him all the foresaid
                  matter, and so went vp both together to attach Tarlton in his chamber, who
                  purposely had shut himselfe close in, and betaken him to his knées, and to his
                  crosses, to make the matter séeme more suspitious, which they espying through
                  the Key-hole, made no more adoe, but in they rushed, and arrested him for a
                  Seminary Priest, discharged his score, bore his, and his boyes charges vp to
                  London, and there in hope to haue rich rewards, presented him to M. Fleetwood,
                  the old Recorder of London: but now marke the Iest; when the Recorder saw
                  Tarlton, and knew him passing well, entertained him very courteously, and all
                  to be foold the Inne-holder and his mate, and sent them away with fleas in
                  their eares: but when Tarlton saw himselfe discharged out of their hands, he
                  stood jesting and pointing at their folly, and so taught them by cunning more
                  wit and thrift against another time.</ab>
