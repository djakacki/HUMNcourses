HEr Maiesty dining in the Strand at the Lord Treasurers, the Lords were very desirous that she would vouchsafe to stay all night, but nothing could preuaile with her: Tarlton was in his Clownes apparell, being all dinner while in the presence with her, to make her merry, and hearing the sorrow that the Noblemen made that they could not worke her stay, he asked the Nobles what they would giue him to worke her stay: the Lords promised him any thing, to performe it: quoth hee, procure me the Parsonage of Shard. They caused the Patent to be drawne presently, he got on a Parsons gowne, and a corner cap, and standing vpon the staires where the Quéene should descend, he repeated these words: a Parson or no Parson? a Parson or no Parson? but after she knew his meaning, she not onely stayed all night, but the next day willed he should haue possession of the benefice: a madder Parson was neuer, for hee threatned to turne the Bel-mettel into lyning for his purse, which hee did, the Parsonage and all, into ready money.

I, saies the one, I hope without exceptions: and I quoth the other, since we must speake for our selues: so then saies Tarlton, one of you by your owne words is dishonest, one being honester then the other, else you would answere otherwise: but as I found you, so I leaue you.

Court 8
How Tarlton answered a wanton Gentlewoman. A Gentlewoman merily disposed, being crost by Tarlton, & halfe angry, said, sirra▪ a little thing would make me requite you with a cuffe: with a cuffe Lady, sayes Tarlton, so would you spel my sorrow forward, but spell my sorrow backward, then cuffe me and spare not: when the Gentlemen by, considered of the Word, their laughing made the simple-meaning Gentlewoman to blush for shame.

Court 9
How Tarlton dared a Lady. AT the dinner in the great Chamber where Tarlton iested, the Ladies were daring one another: quoth one I euer durst any thing that is honest and honourable: a French crowne of that, sayes Tarlton: ten pound of that sayes the Lady: done sayes one, done sayes another. Tarlton put a two-pence betwixt his lips, and dared her to take it away with her lips. Fye saies she, that is immodestie. What, tokisse saies Tarlton? then immodesty beares a great hand ouer all: but once in your life say, you haue béene beaten at your owne weapon. Well sir, saies she, you may say any thing. Then sayes Tarlton, remember I say you dare not, and so my wager is good.

Court 10
How Tarlton landed at Cuckolds hauen. TArlton being one Sunday at Court all day, caused a payre of Oares to tend him, who at night called on him to be gone: Tarlton being a carousing, drunke so long to the Watermen, that one of them was bumpsie, and so indéed were all thrée for the most part: at last they left Gréenwitch, the Tide being at a great low fall, the Watermen yet affraid of the crosse Cables by the Lime-house: very darke and late as it was, landed Tarlton at Cuckolds-hauen, and said the next day they would giue him a reason for it: But Tarlton was faine to goe by land to Reddriffe on the durty banke, euery step knée déepe: so that comming home, hee called one of his boyes to helpe him off with his boots, meaning his stockings, which were dyed of another colour. Whereupon one gaue him this Theame next day.

Tarlton tell me, for faine would I know,
If thou wert landed at Culckolds-hauen or no?

Yes Sir, and I tak't in no scorne,
For many land there, yet misse of the horne.

No quoth Tarlton, it shal be burnt, for thou canst burn it without fire: as how sir? (quoth she) marry thus, take the Cup in thine hand & I will tell thée: So he filling the cup in her hand, said it was burnt sufficiently in so fiery a place: she perceiuing her selfe so flouted, hyred me to be her Champion to reuenge her quarrell.

Court 12
How Tarlton answered the Watchmen comming from the Court. TArlton hauing plaied before the Quéen, till one a clock at midnight, comming homewards, one of them espied him, calling him, sirra, what art thou? a woman, sayes Tarlton: nay that is lie, saith the Watchmen, women haue no such beards: Tarlton replied, if I should haue said a man, that you know to be true, and would haue bidden mee tell you that you know not, therefore I sayd a Woman, and so I am all woman, hauing pleased the Quéene, being a Woman: Well sirra sayes another, I present the Quéene: then am I a woman indéed saies Tarlton as well as you, for you haue a beard as well as I, and truly Mistris Annis, my buske is not done yet, when will yours? leaue thy gybing fellow, saith the Watch; the Quéens will is that whosoeuer is taken without doores after ten a clocke, shall be committed, and now it is past one: commit all such sayes Tarlton, for if it be past one a clocke, it will not be ten this eight houres: with that one lifts vp his Lanthorne, and looks him in the face, and knew him: indéed M. Tarlton you haue more wit then all we, for it is true that ten was before one, but now one is before ten, it is true quoth Tarlton, Watchmen had wont to haue more wit, but for want of sléepe they are turned fooles: so Tarlton stole from them, and they to séeme wise went home to bed.

Court 13
Tarltons answere to a Courtier. TArlton being at the Court all night, in the morning he met a great Courtier comming from his Chamber, who espying Tarlton, said: Good morrow Master Didimus and Tridimus: Tarlton being somewhat abashed, not knowing the meaning thereof, sayd: Sir, I vnderstand you not, expound I pray you: quoth the Courtier Didimus and Tridimus, is a foole and a knaue: you ouer-load me replyed Tarlton, for my backe cannot beare both, therefore take you the one, and I will take the other: take you the knaue, and I will carry the foole with me.

Court 14

THere was an vnthriftie Gallant belonging to the Court that had borrowed fiue pounds of Tarlton, but hauing lost it at Dice, hee sent his man to Tarlton to borrow fiue pounds more, by the same token he owed him already fiue pounds: pray tell your Master, quoth Tarlton, that if he will send me the token, I will send him the money: for who deceiues me once, God forgiue him: If twice, God forgiue him: but if thrice, God forgiue him, but not me, because I could not beware.

Court 17

T O an Ordinary in the White Friers, where Gentlemen vsed, by reason of extraordinarie dyet, to this Tarlton often frequented, as well to continue acquaintance, as to please his appetite: it chanced so vpon a time (especially) being set amongst the Gentlemen and Gallants, they enquired of him why melancholy had got the vpper-hand of his mirth, to which he said little, but with a squint eie, as custom had made him hare▪ eied, he lookt for a Iest to make them merry; at last he espyed one that sate on his left side, which had a very red face, hee being a very great Gentleman (which was all one to Tarlton ) he presently in great hast called his Hoast: who do I serue my Hoast? quoth Tarlton, the Quéenes Maiestie, replied the good man of the house: how happens it then quoth Tarlton, that to her Maiesties disgrace, you dare make me a companion with Seruingmen, clapping my Lord Shandoyes Cullisance vpon my sléeue, looking at the Gentleman with the red face, me thinks quoth he, it sits like the Sarazens head without Newgate: the Gentlemans Salamanders face burnt▪ like Aetna for anger, the rest laughed heartily: in the end all inraged, the Gentleman swore to fight with him at the next méeting.

City 2
A sodaine and dangerous fray, twixt a Gentleman and Tarlton, which he put off with a Iest. AS Tarlton & others passed along Fléestréet, hee espied a spruce yong gallant, blacke of complexion, with long haire hanging downe ouer his eares, and his beard of the Italian cut, in white Satten, very quaintly cut, and his body so stiffe starcht, that he could not bend himselfe any way for no gold: Tarlton, séeing such a wonder comming, trips before him, and méeting this gallant tooke the wall of him, knowing that one so proud, at least looked for the prerogatiue. The gallant scorning that a Player should take the wall, or so much indignifie him, turnes himselfe, and presently drew his Rapier, Tarlton drew likewise: The Gentleman fell to it roundly, but Tarlton in his owne defence, compassing and trauersing his ground, gaped with a wide mouth, whereat the people laughed: the Gentleman pausing, enquired why he gaped so? O Sir saies he, in hope to swallow you, for by my troth, you séeme to me like a prune in a Mesle of white Broth: at this the people parted them, the Gentleman noting his mad humour, went his way well contented, for he knew not how to amend it.

Put yours in, ere I put in the other:
Pippin you haue put in, then for my grace,
Would I might put your nose in another place.

Gentlemen, this fellow with his face of Mapple.
In stead of a Pippin hath throwne me an Apple:
But as for an Apple he hath cast a Crab,
So in stead of an honest woman God hath sent him a Drab.


The people laughed heartily, for he had a Queane to his Wife.

City 5
How Tarlton and one in the Gallerie fell out. IT chanced that in the midst of a Play, after long expectation for Tarlton, (being much desired of the people) at length he came forth: where at his entrance, one in the gallerie pointed his finger at him, saying to a friend that had neuer séene him, that is he: Tarlton to make sport at the least occasion giuen him, and séeing the man point with one finger, he in loue againe held vp two fingers: the captious fellow iealous of his wife (for he was maried) and because a Player did it, tooke the matter more hainously, and askt him why hee made Hornes at him: No quoth Tarlton, they be fingers:

For there is no man which in loue to mee
Lends me one finger, but he shall haue three.


No, no, sayes the fellow, you gaue me the hornes: true saies Tarlton, for my fingers are tipt with nailes which are like hornes, and I must make a shew of that which you are sure of: this matter grew so, that the more he medled, the more it was for his disgrace: wherefore the standers by counselled him to depart, both he and his hornes, lest his cause grew desperate: so the poore fellow plucking his Hat ouer his eyes, went his wayes.

City 6
How Fiddlers fidled away Tarltons apparell. IT chanced that one Fancie and Nancie, a Musition in London, vsed often with their Boyes to visite Tarlton, when he dwelt in Gracious-stréet, at the signe of the Saba, a Tauern▪ he being one of their best friends or benefactors, by reason of old acquaintance: to requite which, they came one summers morning to play him the Hunts' vp with such Musicke as they had: Tarlton, to requite them would open his Chamber doore, and for their paines would giue them Muskadine: which a Cony-catcher noting, and séeing Tarlton come foorth in his shirt and night-gowne to drinke with these Musitions, the while this nimble fellow stept in, and tooke Tarltons apparell which euery day he wore, thinking that if he were espied to turne it to a iest, but it past for currant and he goes his waies: Not long after Tarlton returned to his Chamber, and looked for his clothes, but they were safe enough from him. The next day this was noysed abroad, and one in the mockage threw him this Theam, he playing then at the Curtaine.

Tarlton I will tell thee a iest,
Which after turned to earnest:
One there was as I heard say,
Who in his shirt heard Musicke play,
While all his clothes were stolne away.


Tarlton smiling at this, answered on the sudden thus:

That's certaine, Sir, it is no lye,
That same one in truth was I:
When that the theefe shall pine and lacke,
Then shall I haue cloathes to my backe:
And I together with my fellowes,
May see him ride to Tiburne Gallowes.

True it is Master, as it chanceth now,
The better for me, and the worse for you.

How Tarlton frighted a Country fellow. TArlton passing through London, by chance hee heard a simple Country fellow in an Ale-house, calling for a Kingstone pot of Ale, stept into him and threatned to accuse him of treason, saying: Sirra, I haue séene and tasted of a penny pot of Ale, and haue found good of the price, but of a Kingstone coine I neuer heard, therefore it is some counterfait, and I must know how thou camest by it: hereupon the Countrey fellow was driuen into such a maze, that out of doores he got, and tooke him to his héeles, as though wildfire had followed him.

City 10
How Tarlton was deceiued by his wife in London.

As women in speech can reuile a man,
So can they in silence beguile a man.

IN the time of Scarsitie, a simple Chéesemonger hearing Tarlton commended for his quick wit, came vnto him, and asked him why he thought Chéese and Butter to be so déere: Tarlton answered, because Wood and Coles are so déere, for Butter and Chéese a man may eate without a fire.

With money in my purse.

Tarlton waits dinner time, and then comes, who was admitted presently. Master Tarlton, sayes my Lord Maior, haue you entred an action against me in the Poultry Counter? My Lord, sayes Tarlton, haue you entred an action against me in Woodstréet Counter? Not I in troth, saies my Lord. No saies Tarlton, he was a villaine that told me so then: but if it be not so, forgiue me this fault my Lord, and I will neuer offend in the next: but in the end he begins to sweare, how he will bee reuenged on him that mockt him, and flings out in a rage, But my Lord sayd, stay M.

But before they parted, they foxt Tarlton, at the Castle in Paternoster Row, that Tarlton confest them two Taylors to be honest men: so what they spent in the purse they got in the person: comming but one by Tarltons account, they returned two: but Tarlton comming one, returned lesse by his wit, for that was shrunk in the whetting.

How Tarlton committed a Rakers horse to Ward. VVHen Tarlton dwelt in Gracious stréet, at a Tauerne at the signe of the Saba, he was chosen Scauenger: and often the Ward complained of his slacknes in kéeping the stréets cleane: so on a time when the Cart came, he asked the Raker, why he did his businesse so slackly. Sir said he, my fore-horse was in the fault, who being let blood and drencht yesterday, I durst not labour him: sir said Tarlton, your horse shall smart for it, and so leads him to the Counter, which the Raker laught at, and without his horse did his worke with the rest, thinking Tarltons homor was to iest, and would returne him his horse againe anon: but when that anon came, he was faine to pay all his fées of the prison, as directly as if he himselfe had béene there: for if Tarlton had committed the master, the busines had not gone forward, therefore the horse was in prison for the Master.

City 21
How Tarlton made Armin his adopted sonne to succeed him. TArlton kéeping a Tauerne in Gracious stréet, hee let it to another, who was indebted to Armins Master, a Gold smith in Lumbard stréet: yet he himselfe had a Chamber in the same house. And this Armin being then a wag came often thither to demaund his Masters money, which hee sometimes had, and sometimes had not: in the end the man growing poore, told the boy he had no money for his Master, and he must beare with him. The mans name being Charles, Armin made this verse, writing it with chalke on a waine-scot:

O world how wilt thou lie, is this Charles the great? that I denie:
Indeed Charles the great before,
But now Charles the lesse, being poore.

Tarlton comming into the roome reading it, and partly acquainted with the boyes humor, comming often thither for his M. money, tooke a piece of chalke, & writ this rime by it.

A wag thou art, none can preuent thee,
And thy desert shall content thee:
Let me diuine, as I am, so in time thou'lt be the same.
My adopted sonne therefore be,
To enioy my Clownes suite after me.

And sée how it fell out: the Boy reading this, so loued Tarlton after, that regarding him with more respect, vsed to his playes, and fell in a league with his humour, and priuate practise brought him to present playing, and at this houre performes the same, where at the Globe on the Bancke-side men may sée him.

City 22
Tarltons greeting with Bankes his horse. THere was one Bankes (in the time of Tarlton ) who serued the Earle of Essex, & had a horse of strange qualities: and being at the Crosse-keyes in Gracious stréete, getting money with him (as he was mightily resorted to:) Tarlton then (with his fellowes) playing at the Bell by, came into the Crosse-keyes amongst many people) to sée fashions: which Bankes perceiuing (to make the people laugh) sayes Signior (to his Horse) goe fetch mee the veriest foole in the company, the Iade comes immediatly, and with his mouth drawes Tarlton forth: Tarlton with merry words said nothing, but God a mercy Horse: in the end, Tarlton séeing the people laugh so, was angry inwardly, and said, Sir, had I power of your horse, as you haue, I would doe more then that. Where ere it be said Bankes (to please him) I will charge him to do it: then saies Tarlton, charge him to bring me the veriest whore-master in this company. He shall saies Bankes: Signior saies he, bring M. Tarlton heere the veriest Whoremaster in the company: the Horse leades his master to him: then God a mercy Horse indéed, sayes Tarlton: the people had much adoe to kéepe peace, but Bancks & Tarlton had like to squarde, and the horse by to giue ayme: but euer after it was a by-word through London, God a mercy horse, and is to this day.

City 23
An excellent Iest of Tarlton suddenly spoken. AT the Bull at Bishops-gate was a play of Henry the fift, wherein the Iudge was to take a boxe on the eare, and because he was absent that should take the blow: Tarlton himselfe (euer forward to please) tooke upon him to play the same Iudge, besides his owne part of the Clowne: and Knell then playing Henry the fift, hit Tarlton a sound boxe indéed, which made the people laugh the more, because it was he: but anone the Iudge goes in, & immediatly Tarlton (in his Clownes clothes) comes out, and askes the Actors what newes? O saith one, hadst thou béene here, thou shouldst haue séene Prince Henry hit the Iudge a terribly▪ boxe on the eare: What man, said Tarlton, strike a Iudge? It is true y faith, said the other: no other like, said Tarlton, and it could not be but terrible to the Iudge, when the report so terrifies me, that me thinkes the blow remaines still on my chéeke, that it burnes againe. The people laught at this mightily, and to this day I haue heard it commended for rare: but no maruaile, for he had many of these.

Tarltons Iest with a Boy in the street. A Wag-halter Boy met Tarlton in the stréet, and said: Master Tarlton who liues longest? Marry Boy, sayes Tarlton, he that dies latest: and why die men so fast, said the Boy? because they want breath, said Tarlton: no rather said the Boy, because their time is come: then thy time is come, said Tarlton, sée who comes yonder: Who? said the Boy: Marry said Tarlton, Bull the hangman: or one that would willingly be thy hangman: Nay, hang me then, if I employ him at this time, said the Boy. Well said Tarlton, then thou wilt be hanged by thy owne confession, and so they parted.

A Iest of Tarlton, prouing Mustard to haue wit. TArlton kéeping an Ordinarie in Pater-noster row, and sitting with Gentlemen to make them merry, would approue Mustard, (standing before them) to haue wit: how so sayes one? It is like a witty skold, méeting another skold, knowing that skold will skold, begins to skold first, so saies he, the Mustard being lickt vp, and knowing that you will bite it, begins to bite you first: Ile trie that saies a Gull by, and the Mustard so tickled him, that his eyes watered: how now sayes Tarlton, does my Iest sauour? I, saies the Gull, and bite too: if you had had better wit, sayes Tarlton, you would haue bit first: so then conclude with me, that dumbe vnféeling Mustard, hath more wit then a talking vnféeling foole as you are. Some were pleased and some were not, but all Tarltons care was taken (for his resolution was such euer) before he talkt any Iest.

How Tarlton tooke Tobacco at the first comming vp of it. TArlton (as other Gentlemen vsed) at the first comming vp of Tobacco, did take it more for fashions sake then otherwise, and being in a roome, set betwéene two men ouercome with wine, and they neuer séeing the like, wondred at it, and séeing the vapour come out of Tarltons nose, cried out, fire, fire, and threw a cup of wine in Tarltons face: Make no more stirre quoth Tarlton, the fire is quenched, if the Sheriffes come it will turne to a fine, as the custome is. And drinking that againe, fie sayes the other, what a stincke it makes, I am almost poisoned: If it offend, sayes Tarlton, lets euery one take a little of the smell, and so the sauour will quickly goe: but Tobacco whiffes made them leaue him to pay all.

Tarltons wit betweene a Bird and a Woodcocke. I N the Citie of Glocester, Master Bird of the Chappell met with Tarlton, who ioyfull to regréet other, went to visit his friends: amongst the rest, M. Bird of the Quéens Chappell visited Master Woodcock of the Colledge, where méeting, many frindly spéeches past, amongst which, M. Woodcocke challenged M. Bird of kin: who mused that he was of his affinitie and hee neuer knew it: yes sayes M. Woodcocke, euery Woodcocke is a Bird, therefore it must néeds be so. Lord, Sir, sayes Tarlton, you are wide, for though euery Woodcocke be a Bird, yet euery Bird is not a Woodcocke. So M. Woodcocke like a Woodcocke bit his lip, and mum budged was silent.

Country 2
Tarltons Iest of a Gridiron. VVHile the Quéens Plaiers lay in Worcester Citie to get money, it was his custome oft to sing extempory of Theams giuen him: amongst which they were appoynted to play the next day: now one fellow of the City amongst the rest, that séemed quaint of conceit, to lead other youths with his fine wit, gaue out that the next day hee would giue him a Theam, to put him to a non plus: diuers of his friends acquainted with the same, expected some rare conceit: Well, the next day came, and my gallant gaue him his inuention in two lines, which was this this:

Me thinkes it is a thing vnfit.
To see a Gridiron turne the spit.

The people laughed at this, thinking his wit knew no answere thereunto, which angered Tarlton excéedingly, and presently with a smile looking about, when they expected wonders, he put it off thus:

Me thinkes it is a thing vnfit,
To see an Asse haue any wit.

The people hooted for ioy, to sée the Theame-giuer dasht, who like a dog with his taile betwéene his legs, left the place: But such commendations Tarlton got, that hee supt with the Bailiffe that night, where my Theamer durst not come, although he were sent for, so much he vexed at that vnlookt▪ for answere.

Tarltons answere in defence of his flat nose. I Remember I was once at a Play▪ in the Country, where as Tarltons vse was, the Play being done, euery one so pleased to throwe vp his Theame: amongst all the rest, one was read to this same effect, word by word.

Tarlton, I am one of thy friends, and none of thy foes,
Then I prethee tell how thou cam'st by thy flat nose:
Had I beene present at that time on those bankes,
I would haue layd my short sword ouer his long shankes.

Tarlton mad at this question, as it was his propertie sooner to take such a matter ill then well, very suddenly returned him this answere:

Friend or foe, if thou wilt needs know, marke me well,
With parting dogs & beares, then by the ears, this chance fel:
But what of that? though my nose be flat, my credit to saue,
Yet very well, I can by the smell, scent an honest man from a knaue.

Tarltons Iest of a Bristowman. VVHen the Quéenes Players were restrained in Summer, they trauailed downe to S. Iames his Faire, at Bristowe, where they were worthily entertained both of Londoners, and those Citizens: it happened that a wealthy Citizen, called M. Sunbanke, one morning secretly married his Maid; but not so secret, but it was blowne abroad: that morning, Tarlton and others, walking in the Faire to visit his familiar friends of London, and being in company of Bristow men, they did sée M. Sunbancke comming, who had this propertie with his necke, not to stirre it any way, but to turne body & all: it chanced at the Faire end, he stood to pisse against a wall: to whom Tarlton came, and clapping him on the shoulder, God giue you ioy of your marriage, saies he: M. Sunbanke being taken pissing against the wall, would haue lookt backe to thanke him, and suddainly turnes about body and all, in the view of many, and shewed all: which so abasht him, that ashamed he tooke into a Tauerne, protesting that he had rather haue spent ten pound: sure sayd the Vintner, the fault is in your necke, who will not turne without the bodies assistance, and not in M. Tarlton: Call you him M. Tarlton, saies M. Sunbancke? I Sir, saies the Vintner, he is the Quéens Iester: he may be whose Iester he will be, but this Iest agrées not with me at this time.

A Iest broken of Tarlton by a Country Gentleman. IN the Country where the Quéens Players were accepted into a Gentlemans house: the Waggon vnloading of the apparell, the Waggoner comes to Tarlton, & doth desire him to speake to the Steward for his horses: I will sayes he, and comming to the Steward, Sir, saies Tarlton, where shall our Horses spend the time? The Gentleman looking at Tarlton at that question, suddenly answered, if it please you, or them, let them walke a turne or two: or there is a faire Garden, let them play a game or two at bowles in the Alley, and departs thence about his other businesse. Tarlton commending the suddaine wit of the steward, said little: but my Steward not quiet, tels to the Gentlewomen aboue, how he had driuen Tarlton to a nonplus with a iest: whereat they all did laugh heartily: which a Seruingman louing Tarlton well, came and told him as much. Tarlton to adde fuell to the fire, and loath to rest thus put off with a iest, goes and gets two of the horses into the Garden, and turns them into the Bowling Alley, who with their héeles made hauocke, being the Gentlemans only pastime: The Ladies aboue from a window, séeing horses in the Garden Alley, call the Knight, who cries out to Tarlton, Fellow, what meanest thou? nothing Sir, saies he, but two of my horses are at seuen vp, for a pecke of Prouender, a foolish match that I made: now they being in play at bowles, run, run: your steward may come after and crie rub, rub: at which, though they smiled, yet the steward had no thankes for his labour, to set the horses to such an exercise: and they could not blame Tarlton, who did but as he was bidden: but by this Iest Oats and Hay, stable-roome, and all, was plenty.

How Tarlton made one of his company vtterly forsweare drunkennesse. AT Salisbury Tarlton & his fellowes were to play before the Maior & his brethren: but one of his company, a yong man was so drunke that he could not: whereat Tarlton as mad angry, as he was mad drunke, claps me on his legs a huge payre of boults: the fellow dead asléep felt nothing: when all was done, they conuaied him to the Iayle on a mans backe, and intreated the Iayler to doe God good seruice, and let him lie there till he waked. While they were about their sport the fellow waked, and finding himselfe in durance, and the Iayle hung round with bolts and shakels, he began to blesse himselfe, and thought sure in his drunkennes he had done some mischiefe: with that he called to know, but none came to him, then he thought verely his fault was capitall, and that hee was close prisoner: by and by comes the Kéeper, and moaned him, that one so yong should come to so shamefull a death as hanging: anone, another comes, and another with the like, which further put him in a puzzle: but at last comes Tarlton and others, intreating the Kéeper, yet if it might be, that they might sée their fellow ere they went, but hee very hardly was intreated, but at length the poore drunken Signior cal'd out for them: in they come. Oh Tom, sayes Tarlton, hard was thy hap in drunkennesse to murder this honest man, and our hard hap too, to haue it reported any of our company is hangd for it. O God, O God saies the fellow, is my fault so great? then commend me to all my friends. Well, short tale to make, the fellow forswore drunkennesse if he could escape, and by as cunning a wile to his thinking, they got him out of prison by an escape, and sent him to London before, who was not a litle glad he was gone: but sée how this Iest wrought, by little and little the fellow left his excessiue drinking, and in timealtered his desire of drunkennesse.

Tarlton answered, tut sir, thats nothing with your worship to do, you can as easily strike off two heads at one blow as one: wherefore, if you please▪ Ile go downe and call vp another, and so you may strike off both our heads at once: the mad-man beleeued him, and so let him slip away.

Constable be good in your Office, I will approue what I haue sayd to be true. If thou canst, sayes the Constable, you shall passe, otherwise you shall be all thrée punished. Why quoth Tarlton, this fellow is an eye-maker, because a Spectacle maker, and this other a maker of light, because a Chandler, that makes your darkest night as light as your Lanthorne. The Constable séeing them so pleasant, was we'l contented, the rest of the Watchmen laughed, and Tarlton with his two companions went home quietly.

Night and the houre came, and the maid subtily sent downe her mistresse ; whome Tarlton catching in his armes, Art come, wench ? saies hee. Out, alas, sayes the mietres, not knowing who it was. Tarlton, hearing it was the mistris, start aside, and the maid came downe with a candle, and she espyed a glimpse of Tarlton in the darke, who stept into another roome. How now, mistres ? said the maid. Something, said shee, affrighted me ; some man, sure, for I heard him speake. No, no, mistresse, said the maid ; it is no man ; it was a bull calf that I shut into a roome till J oho, our pounder, came to have pounded him for a stray. Had I thought that, saith she, I would have hit him such a knocke on his forehead that his home should never have grac'd his coxcombe ; and so she departs up againe, afraid.

Sayes Tarlton, To morrow morning the divell shall helpe you to it, or I will trounce him. Morning came, and the oastesse and he met in a roome by themselves. Tarlton, to passe the time with exercise of his wit, with circles and tricks falls to conjure, having no more skill then a dogge. But see the jest, how contrarily it fell out : as he was calling out, mons, pons, simul, and sons, and such like, a cat, unexpected, leapt from the gutter window ; which sight so amazed Tarlton, that he skipt thence and threw his hostesse downe, so that he departed with his fellowes, and left her hip out of joynt,, being then in the surgeons hands, and not daring to tell how it came.

Sir, saies shee, then let me request your company at my house, at the Christopher, and, for old familiarity, spend your money there. Not unlesse you goe backe, saies Tarlton. We will else goe to the Hound. But she, loth to lose their custome, sent to London by her man, and goes back with them ; who by the way had much mirth, for she was an exceeding merry honest woman, yet would take anything : which Tarlton hearing, as wise as he was, thinking her of his minde, he was deceived : yet he askt her if the biggest bed in her house were able to hold two of their bignesse ; meaning himself and her. Yes, saies she, and tumble up and downe at pleasure. Yea, one upon another, saies Tarlton. And under, to, saies she. Well, to have their custome, she agreed to everything, like a subtill oastesse : and it fell so out that Tarlton, having her in a roome at her house, askt her which of those two beds were big enough for them two. This, said she : therefore, goe to bed, sweet-heart, Ile come to thee. Masse, saies Tarlton, were my bootes off, I would, indeed. Ile help you, sir, saies she, if you please. Yea, thought Tarlton, is the wind in that doore? Come on, then. And she very diligently begins to pull, till one boot was half off. Now, saies she, this being hard to doe, let me try my cunning on the other, and so get off both. But, having both half off his legs, she left. him alone in the shoemakers stocks, and got her to London, where
Tarlton was three houres, and had no help. But, being eas'd
of his paine, he made this ryme for a theame, singing of it all

Women are wanton, and hold it no sinne,
By tricks and devices to pull a man in.

But Tarlton demanded of his father if it were so. But he knew no such matter. Whereupon, saies Tarlton, whether he be of my kin or no, I will be cousin to him ere we part, if all the drinke in Ilford will doe it. So upon this they carouse freely, and the clowne was then in his cue, so that, in briefe, they were both in soundly. Night came, and Tarlton would not let his cousin goe, but they would lye together that night, meaning to drinke at their departure next morning. Tarlton would by wit leave him in the lash, since power would not. But see the jest. That night the plaine fellow so .... Tarlton in his bed, thinking he had been against the church wall, that he was faine to cry for a fresh shirt to shift. him. So, when al was well, they must needs drinke at parting : where, indeed, to seale kindred soundly, the fellow had his loade; for, hearing that his cousin Tarlton was gone to London, Zounds, he would follow, that he would, none could hold him; and, meaning to goe towards London, his aime was so good, that he went towards Rumford to sell his hogs.

But it may be Munday thinkes himselfe Sundayes fellow, because it followes Sunday, and is next after: but he comes a day after the faire for that. Nay, saies the fellow, but if two Sundayes fall together, Munday then may be the first, and it would shew well too. Yes, saies Tarlton, but if thy nose stood under thy mouth, it would shew better, and be more for thy profit. How for my profit, said the fellow ? Marry, said Tarlton, never to be cold in winter, being so neere every dogs taile. The fellow seeing a foolish question had a foolish answere, laid his legges on his neck, and got him gone.

Yes, saies a lady, mine is more strange, for he will beare a French crowne in his mouth. No, saies Tarlton, I thinke not. Lend me a French crowne, saies the lady, and you shall see. Truly, madame, I have it not, but if your dog will carry a crackt English crowne here it is. But the lady perceived not the jest, but was desirous to see the dogs trick of sixpence. Tarlton threw down a teaster, and said, Bring, sirra, and by fortune the dog took up a counter, and let the money lie. A gentlewoman by, seeing that, askt him how long he would hold it! An houre, saies Tarlton. That is pretty, said the gentlewoman, let's see that. Meane time she tooke up the sixe-pence, and willed him to let them see the money againe ; when he did see it it was a counter, and he made this rime :-

Alas, alas, how came all this to passe !
The world's worse than it was ;
For silver turns to brasse.

I, sayes the lady, and the dog hath made his master an asse. But Tarlton would never trust to his dogs tricks more.

Tarlton's jest of a horse and a man.
In the city of Norwich, Tarlton was on a time invited to an hunting, where there was a goodly gentlewoman, that bravely mounted on a blacke horse, rode exceeding well, to the wonder of all the beholders ; and neither hedge nor ditch stood in her way, but Pegasus, her horse, for so may we tearme him for swiftnesse, flew over all, and she sate him as well. When every one returned home, some at supper commended hie hound, others his hawke, and shee above all, her horse. And, said she, I love no living creature so well, at this instant, as my gallant horse. Yes, lady, a man better, saies Tarlton. Indeed no, said shee, not now ; for since my last husband dyed I hate them most, unlesse you can give me medicines to make me love them. Tarlton made this jest instantly :-

Why, a horse mingeth whay, madam, a man mingeth amber,
A horse is for your way, madam, but a man for your chamber.

God a mercy, Tarlton, said the men: which the gentlewoman noting, seeing they tooke exceptions at her words, to make all well, answered thus :-

That a horse is my chiefe opinion now, I deny not,
And when a man doth me more good in my chamber I him defie not.

But till then give me leave to love something. Then something will please you, said Tarlton, I am glad of that, therefore I pray God send you a good thing or none at all.

Gentlewoman, said Tarlton, and the rest as you sit, I can tell you strange things : now many gallants at supper noted one woman, who being little and pretty, to unfit her prettinesse had a great wide mouth, which she seeming to hide, would pinch in her speeches, and speake small, but .was desirous to heare newes. Tarlton told at his comming from London to Norwich, a proclamation was made that every man should have two wives. Now Jesus, qd. she, is it possible? Ay gentlewoman, and otherwise able too, for contrarily women have a larger preeminence, for every woman must have three husbands. Now Jawsus, said the gentlewoman, and with wonder shewes the full widenesse of her mouth, which all the table smil'd at ; which she perceiving, would answere no more. Now mistris, said Tarlton, your mouth is lease than ever it was, for now it is able to say nothing. Thou art a cogging knave, said she. Masse, and that is something, yet, said Tarlton, your mouth shall be as wide as ever it was for that jest.

A jest of Tarlton to a great man.
There was a great huge man, three yards in the wast, at S. Edmondsbury, in Suffolk, that died but of late daies, one M. Blague, by name, and a good kinde justice, too, carefull for the poore : this justice met with Tarlton in Norwich ; Tarlton, said he, give me thy hand. But you, sir, being richer, may give me a greater gift, give me your body, and embracing him, could not halfe compasse him. Being merry in talke, said the justice, Tarlton, tell me one thing, what is the difference betwixt a flea and a louse? Marry, sir, said Tarlton, as much and like difference as twixt you and me : I, like a flea, see else, can skip nimbly, but you, like a fat louse, creepe slowly, and you can go no faster, though butchers are over you, ready to knock you on the head. Thou art a knave, quoth the justice. I, sir, I knew that, ere I came hither, else I had not been here now, for ever one knave, making a stop, seekes out another. The justice, understanding him, laughed heartily.

Tarlton's jest to a maid in the dark.
Tarlton going in the darke, groping out his way, heares the tread of some one to meet him. Who goes there, saies he, a man or a monster! Said the maid, a monster. Said Tarlton, a candle hoe ; and seeing who it was, Indeed, said he, a monster, I'le be sworne, for thy teeth are longer than thy beard. 0, sir, said the man, speake no more then you see, for women goe invisible now adayes.

Tarlton's jest to a dogge.
Tarlton and his fellowes, being in the Bishop of Worcester's sellar, and being largely laid to, Tarlton had his rouse, and going through the streets, a dogge, in the middle of the street, asleep on a dunghill, seeing Tarlton reele on him, on the sodaine barkt. How now, dog, saies Tarlton, are yon in your humours! and many daies after it was a by-word to a man being drunke, that he was in his humours.
