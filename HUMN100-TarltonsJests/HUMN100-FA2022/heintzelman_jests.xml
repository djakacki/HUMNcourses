               <ab>IT chanced that in the midst of a Play, after long expectation for Tarlton,
                  (being much desired of the people) at length he came forth: where at his
                  entrance, one in the gallerie pointed his finger at him, saying to a friend
                  that had neuer séene him, that is he: Tarlton to make sport at the least
                  occasion giuen him, and séeing the man point with one finger, he in loue againe
                  held vp two fingers: the captious fellow iealous of his wife (for he was
                  maried) and because a Player did it, tooke the matter more hainously, and askt
                  him why hee made Hornes at him: No quoth Tarlton, they be fingers:</ab>
               <lg>
                  <l>For there is no man which in loue to mee</l>
                  <l>Lends me one finger, but he shall haue three.</l>
               </lg>
               <ab>No, no, sayes the fellow, you gaue me the hornes: true saies Tarlton, for my
                  fingers are tipt with nailes which are like hornes, and I must make a shew of
                  that which you are sure of: this matter grew so, that the more he medled, the
                  more it was for his disgrace: wherefore the standers by counselled him to
                  depart, both he and his hornes, lest his cause grew desperate: so the poore
                  fellow plucking his Hat ouer his eyes, went his wayes.</ab>

               <ab>IT chanced that one Fancie and Nancie, a Musition in London, vsed often with
                  their Boyes to visite Tarlton, when he dwelt in Gracious-stréet, at the signe
                  of the Saba, a Tauern▪ he being one of their best friends or benefactors, by
                  reason of old acquaintance: to requite which, they came one summers morning to
                  play him the Hunts' vp with such Musicke as they had: Tarlton, to requite them
                  would open his Chamber doore, and for their paines would giue them Muskadine:
                  which a Cony-catcher noting, and séeing Tarlton come foorth in his shirt and
                  night-gowne to drinke with these Musitions, the while this nimble fellow stept
                  in, and tooke Tarltons apparell which euery day he wore, thinking that if he
                  were espied to turne it to a iest, but it past for currant and he goes his
                  waies: Not long after Tarlton returned to his Chamber, and looked for his
                  clothes, but they were safe enough from him. The next day this was noysed
                  abroad, and one in the mockage threw him this Theam, he playing then at the
                  Curtaine.</ab>
