               <ab>THere was one Bankes (in the time of Tarlton ) who serued the Earle of Essex,
                  &amp; had a horse of strange qualities: and being at the Crosse-keyes in
                  Gracious stréete, getting money with him (as he was mightily resorted to:)
                  Tarlton then (with his fellowes) playing at the Bell by, came into the
                  Crosse-keyes amongst many people) to sée fashions: which Bankes perceiuing (to
                  make the people laugh) sayes Signior (to his Horse) goe fetch mee the veriest
                  foole in the company, the Iade comes immediatly, and with his mouth drawes
                  Tarlton forth: Tarlton with merry words said nothing, but God a mercy Horse: in
                  the end, Tarlton séeing the people laugh so, was angry inwardly, and said, Sir,
                  had I power of your horse, as you haue, I would doe more then that. Where ere
                  it be said Bankes (to please him) I will charge him to do it: then saies
                  Tarlton, charge him to bring me the veriest whore-master in this company. He
                  shall saies Bankes: Signior saies he, bring M. Tarlton heere the veriest
                  Whoremaster in the company: the Horse leades his master to him: then God a
                  mercy Horse indéed, sayes Tarlton: the people had much adoe to kéepe peace, but
                  Bancks &amp; Tarlton had like to squarde, and the horse by to giue ayme: but
                  euer after it was a by-word through London, God a mercy horse, and is to this
                  day.</ab>

               <ab>AT the Bull at Bishops-gate was a play of Henry the fift, wherein the Iudge
                  was to take a boxe on the eare, and because he was absent that should take the
                  blow: Tarlton himselfe (euer forward to please) tooke upon him to play the same
                  Iudge, besides his owne part of the Clowne: and Knell then playing Henry the
                  fift, hit Tarlton a sound boxe indéed, which made the people laugh the more,
                  because it was he: but anone the Iudge goes in, &amp; immediatly Tarlton (in
                  his Clownes clothes) comes out, and askes the Actors what newes? O saith one,
                  hadst thou béene here, thou shouldst haue séene Prince Henry hit the Iudge a
                  terribly▪ boxe on the eare: What man, said Tarlton, strike a Iudge? It is true
                  y faith, said the other: no other like, said Tarlton, and it could not be but
                  terrible to the Iudge, when the report so terrifies me, that me thinkes the
                  blow remaines still on my chéeke, that it burnes againe. The people laught at
                  this mightily, and to this day I haue heard it commended for rare: but no
                  maruaile, for he had many of these. But I would sée our Clownes in these dayes
                  doe the like, no I warrant ye, and yet they thinke well of themselues too.</ab>
