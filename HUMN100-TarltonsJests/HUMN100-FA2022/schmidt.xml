               <head><title>How Tarlton and his oastesse of Waltham met.</title></head>
               <ab>Tarlton, riding with divers cittizens, his friends, to make merry at Waltham,
                  by the way he met with his oastesse, riding toward London, whome hee of old
                  acquaintance saluted. Shee demands whither they went. Tarlton told her, to make
                  merry at Waltham. Sir, saies shee, then let me request your company at my
                  house, at the Christopher, and, for old familiarity, spend your money there.
                  Not unlesse you goe backe, saies Tarlton. We will else goe to the Hound. But
                  she, loth to lose their custome, sent to London by her man, and goes back with
                  them ; who by the way had much mirth, for she was an exceeding merry honest
                  woman, yet would take anything : which Tarlton hearing, as wise as he was,
                  thinking her of his minde, he was deceived : yet he askt her if the biggest bed
                  in her house were able to hold two of their bignesse ; meaning himself and her.
                  Yes, saies she, and tumble up and downe at pleasure. Yea, one upon another,
                  saies Tarlton. And under, to, saies she. Well, to have their custome, she
                  agreed to everything, like a subtill oastesse : and it fell so out that
                  Tarlton, having her in a roome at her house, askt her which of those two beds
                  were big enough for them two. This, said she : therefore, goe to bed,
                  sweet-heart, Ile come to thee. Masse, saies Tarlton, were my bootes off, I
                  would, indeed. Ile help you, sir, saies she, if you please. Yea, thought
                  Tarlton, is the wind in that doore? Come on, then. And she very diligently
                  begins to pull, till one boot was half off. Now, saies she, this being hard to
                  doe, let me try my cunning on the other, and so get off both. But, having both
                  half off his legs, she left. him alone in the shoemakers stocks, and got her to
                  London, where Tarlton was three houres, and had no help. But, being eas'd of
                  his paine, he made this ryme for a theame, singing of it all the way to London
