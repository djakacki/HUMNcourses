                     desirous that she would vouchsafe to stay all night, but nothing could preuaile
                     with her: Tarlton was in his Clownes apparell, being all dinner while in the
                     presence with her, to make her merry, and hearing the sorrow that the Noblemen
                     made that they could not worke her stay, he asked the Nobles what they would
                     giue him to worke her stay: the Lords promised him any thing, to performe it:
                     quoth hee, procure me the Parsonage of Shard. They caused the Patent to be
                     drawne presently, he got on a Parsons gowne, and a corner cap, and standing
                     vpon the staires where the Quéene should descend, he repeated these words: a
                     Parson or no Parson? a Parson or no Parson? but after she knew his meaning, she
                     not onely stayed all night, but the next day willed he should haue possession
                     of the benefice: a madder Parson was neuer, for hee threatned to turne the
                     Bel-mettel into lyning for his purse, which hee did, the Parsonage and all,

                     said, sirra▪ a little thing would make me requite you with a cuffe: with a
                     cuffe Lady, sayes Tarlton, so would you spel my sorrow forward, but spell my
                     sorrow backward, then cuffe me and spare not: when the Gentlemen by, considered
                     of the Word, their laughing made the simple-meaning Gentlewoman to blush for
                     shame.</ab>

                  <ab>AT the dinner in the great Chamber where Tarlton iested, the Ladies were
                     daring one another: quoth one I euer durst any thing that is honest and
                     honourable: a French crowne of that, sayes Tarlton: ten pound of that sayes the
                     Lady: done sayes one, done sayes another. Tarlton put a two-pence betwixt his
                     lips, and dared her to take it away with her lips. Fye saies she, that is
                     immodestie. What, tokisse saies Tarlton? then immodesty beares a great hand
                     ouer all: but once in your life say, you haue béene beaten at your owne weapon.
                     Well sir, saies she, you may say any thing. Then sayes Tarlton, remember I say
                     you dare not, and so my wager is good.</ab>

                  <ab>TArlton being one Sunday at Court all day, caused a payre of Oares to tend
                     him, who at night called on him to be gone: Tarlton being a carousing, drunke
                     so long to the Watermen, that one of them was bumpsie, and so indéed were all
                     thrée for the most part: at last they left Gréenwitch, the Tide being at a
                     great low fall, the Watermen yet affraid of the crosse Cables by the
                     Lime-house: very darke and late as it was, landed Tarlton at Cuckolds-hauen,
                     and said the next day they would giue him a reason for it: But Tarlton was
                     faine to goe by land to Reddriffe on the durty banke, euery step knée déepe: so
                     that comming home, hee called one of his boyes to helpe him off with his boots,
                     meaning his stockings, which were dyed of another colour. Whereupon one gaue
                     him this Theame next day.</ab>

                  <ab>NOt long since liued a little swaggerer, called blacke Dauie, who would at
                     Sword and Buckler fight with any gentleman or other, for 12. pence: he being
                     hired to draw vpon Tarlton, for breaking a iest vpon huffin Kate, a puncke as
                     men tearmed her: one euening Tarlton comming forth at the Court-gate, being at
                     Whitehal, and walking toward the Tilt-yard, this Dauie immediatly drew vpon
                     Tarlton: who on the sudden, though amazed, drew likewise, and inquired the
                     cause, which Dauie denied, till they had fought about or two: Tarlton
                     couragiously got within him, and taking him in his armes, threw him into the
                     Tilt-yard, who falling vpon his nose, broke it extreamely, that euer after he
                     snuffled in the head; poore Dauie lying all that night in the Tilt-yard,
                     expecting the doores to be opened, came forth, and at the Barber▪ surgeons told
                     of this bloody combat, and the occasion of it was (quoth hee) because Tarlton
                     being in a Tauerne in the companie of this damnable Cockatrice huffing Kate,
                     called for wine: but she told him that without he would burne it, she would not
                     drinke. No quoth Tarlton, it shal be burnt, for thou canst burn it without
                     fire: as how sir? (quoth she) marry thus, take the Cup in thine hand &amp; I
                     will tell thée: So he filling the cup in her hand, said it was burnt
                     sufficiently in so fiery a place: she perceiuing her selfe so flouted, hyred me
                     to be her Champion to reuenge her quarrell.</ab>

                     homewards, one of them espied him, calling him, sirra, what art thou? a woman,
                     sayes Tarlton: nay that is lie, saith the Watchmen, women haue no such beards:
                     Tarlton replied, if I should haue said a man, that you know to be true, and
                     would haue bidden mee tell you that you know not, therefore I sayd a Woman, and
                     so I am all woman, hauing pleased the Quéene, being a Woman: Well sirra sayes
                     another, I present the Quéene: then am I a woman indéed saies Tarlton as well
                     as you, for you haue a beard as well as I, and truly Mistris Annis, my buske is
                     not done yet, when will yours? leaue thy gybing fellow, saith the Watch; the
                     Quéens will is that whosoeuer is taken without doores after ten a clocke, shall
                     be committed, and now it is past one: commit all such sayes Tarlton, for if it
                     be past one a clocke, it will not be ten this eight houres: with that one lifts
                     vp his Lanthorne, and looks him in the face, and knew him: indéed M. Tarlton
                     you haue more wit then all we, for it is true that ten was before one, but now
                     one is before ten, it is true quoth Tarlton, Watchmen had wont to haue more
                     wit, but for want of sléepe they are turned fooles: so Tarlton stole from them,
                     and they to séeme wise went home to bed.</ab>

                     being set amongst the Gentlemen and Gallants, they enquired of him why
                     melancholy had got the vpper-hand of his mirth, to which he said little, but

                  <ab>AS Tarlton &amp; others passed along Fléestréet, hee espied a spruce yong
                     gallant, blacke of complexion, with long haire hanging downe ouer his eares,
                     and his beard of the Italian cut, in white Satten, very quaintly cut, and his
                     body so stiffe starcht, that he could not bend himselfe any way for no gold:
                     Tarlton, séeing such a wonder comming, trips before him, and méeting this
                     gallant tooke the wall of him, knowing that one so proud, at least looked for
                     the prerogatiue. The gallant scorning that a Player should take the wall, or so
                     much indignifie him, turnes himselfe, and presently drew his Rapier, Tarlton
                     drew likewise: The Gentleman fell to it roundly, but Tarlton in his owne
                     defence, compassing and trauersing his ground, gaped with a wide mouth, whereat
                     the people laughed: the Gentleman pausing, enquired why he gaped so? O Sir
                     saies he, in hope to swallow you, for by my troth, you séeme to me like a prune
                     in a Mesle of white Broth: at this the people parted them, the Gentleman noting
                     his mad humour, went his way well contented, for he knew not how to amend
                     it.</ab>

                     occasion giuen him, and séeing the man point with one finger, he in loue againe
                     held vp two fingers: the captious fellow iealous of his wife (for he was
                     maried) and because a Player did it, tooke the matter more hainously, and askt
                     him why hee made Hornes at him: No quoth Tarlton, they be fingers:</ab>

                  </lg>
                  <ab>No, no, sayes the fellow, you gaue me the hornes: true saies Tarlton, for my
                     fingers are tipt with nailes which are like hornes, and I must make a shew of
                     that which you are sure of: this matter grew so, that the more he medled, the
                     more it was for his disgrace: wherefore the standers by counselled him to
                     depart, both he and his hornes, lest his cause grew desperate: so the poore

                     be so déere: Tarlton answered, because Wood and Coles are so déere, for Butter
                     and Chéese a man may eate without a fire.</ab>

                     he was chosen Scauenger: and often the Ward complained of his slacknes in
                     kéeping the stréets cleane: so on a time when the Cart came, he asked the
                     Raker, why he did his businesse so slackly. Sir said he, my fore-horse was in
                     the fault, who being let blood and drencht yesterday, I durst not labour him:
                     sir said Tarlton, your horse shall smart for it, and so leads him to the
                     Counter, which the Raker laught at, and without his horse did his worke with
                     the rest, thinking Tarltons homor was to iest, and would returne him his horse
                     againe anon: but when that anon came, he was faine to pay all his fées of the
                     prison, as directly as if he himselfe had béene there: for if Tarlton had
                     committed the master, the busines had not gone forward, therefore the horse was

                  <ab>AT the Bull at Bishops-gate was a play of Henry the fift, wherein the Iudge
                     was to take a boxe on the eare, and because he was absent that should take the
                     blow: Tarlton himselfe (euer forward to please) tooke upon him to play the same
                     Iudge, besides his owne part of the Clowne: and Knell then playing Henry the
                     fift, hit Tarlton a sound boxe indéed, which made the people laugh the more,
                     because it was he: but anone the Iudge goes in, &amp; immediatly Tarlton (in
                     his Clownes clothes) comes out, and askes the Actors what newes? O saith one,
                     hadst thou béene here, thou shouldst haue séene Prince Henry hit the Iudge a
                     terribly▪ boxe on the eare: What man, said Tarlton, strike a Iudge? It is true
                     y faith, said the other: no other like, said Tarlton, and it could not be but
                     terrible to the Iudge, when the report so terrifies me, that me thinkes the
                     blow remaines still on my chéeke, that it burnes againe. The people laught at
                     this mightily, and to this day I haue heard it commended for rare: but no
                     maruaile, for he had many of these. But I would sée our Clownes in these dayes
                     doe the like, no I warrant ye, and yet they thinke well of themselues too.</ab>

                     how so sayes one? It is like a witty skold, méeting another skold, knowing that
                     skold will skold, begins to skold first, so saies he, the Mustard being lickt
                     vp, and knowing that you will bite it, begins to bite you first: Ile trie that
                     saies a Gull by, and the Mustard so tickled him, that his eyes watered: how now
                     sayes Tarlton, does my Iest sauour? I, saies the Gull, and bite too: if you had
                     had better wit, sayes Tarlton, you would haue bit first: so then conclude with
                     me, that dumbe vnféeling Mustard, hath more wit then a talking vnféeling foole

                     taken (for his resolution was such euer) before he talkt any Iest.</ab>

                     it more for fashions sake then otherwise, and being in a roome, set betwéene

                     séeing the vapour come out of Tarltons nose, cried out, fire, fire, and threw a
                     cup of wine in Tarltons face: Make no more stirre quoth Tarlton, the fire is
                     quenched, if the Sheriffes come it will turne to a fine, as the custome is. And
                     drinking that againe, fie sayes the other, what a stincke it makes, I am almost
                     poisoned: If it offend, sayes Tarlton, lets euery one take a little of the
                     smell, and so the sauour will quickly goe: but Tobacco whiffes made them leaue

                     sée M. Sunbancke comming, who had this propertie with his necke, not to stirre

                     pissing against the wall, would haue lookt backe to thanke him, and suddainly

                     comming to the Steward, Sir, saies Tarlton, where shall our Horses spend the
                     time? The Gentleman looking at Tarlton at that question, suddenly answered, if
                     it please you, or them, let them walke a turne or two: or there is a faire
                     Garden, let them play a game or two at bowles in the Alley, and departs thence
                     about his other businesse. Tarlton commending the suddaine wit of the steward,

                     goes and gets two of the horses into the Garden, and turns them into the

                     and they could not blame Tarlton, who did but as he was bidden: but by this

                        drunkennesse.</title></head>
                  <ab>AT Salisbury Tarlton &amp; his fellowes were to play before the Maior &amp;
                     his brethren: but one of his company, a yong man was so drunke that he could
                     not: whereat Tarlton as mad angry, as he was mad drunke, claps me on his legs a
                     huge payre of boults: the fellow dead asléep felt nothing: when all was done,
                     they conuaied him to the Iayle on a mans backe, and intreated the Iayler to doe
                     God good seruice, and let him lie there till he waked. While they were about
                     their sport the fellow waked, and finding himselfe in durance, and the Iayle
                     hung round with bolts and shakels, he began to blesse himselfe, and thought
                     sure in his drunkennes he had done some mischiefe: with that he called to know,
                     but none came to him, then he thought verely his fault was capitall, and that
                     hee was close prisoner: by and by comes the Kéeper, and moaned him, that one so
                     yong should come to so shamefull a death as hanging: anone, another comes, and
                     another with the like, which further put him in a puzzle: but at last comes
                     Tarlton and others, intreating the Kéeper, yet if it might be, that they might
                     sée their fellow ere they went, but hee very hardly was intreated, but at
                     length the poore drunken Signior cal'd out for them: in they come. Oh Tom,
                     sayes Tarlton, hard was thy hap in drunkennesse to murder this honest man, and
                     our hard hap too, to haue it reported any of our company is hangd for it. O
                     God, O God saies the fellow, is my fault so great? then commend me to all my
                     friends. Well, short tale to make, the fellow forswore drunkennesse if he could
                     escape, and by as cunning a wile to his thinking, they got him out of prison by
                     an escape, and sent him to London before, who was not a litle glad he was gone:
                     but sée how this Iest wrought, by little and little the fellow left his
                     excessiue drinking, and in timealtered his desire of drunkennesse.</ab>

                  <ab>VPon a time when the Plaiers were put to silence, Tarlton and his boy frolickt
                     so long in the Country, that all their money was gone, and being a great way
                     from London, they knew not what to doe; but as want is the whetstone of wit,
                     Tarlton gathereth his conceit together, and practised a tricke to beare him vp
                     to London without money, &amp; thus it was: Vnto an Inne in Sandwich they went,
                     and there lay for two daies at great charge, although he had no money to pay
                     for the same: the third morning he bad his man go downe and male-content
                     himselfe before his Hoast and his Hoastesse, &amp; mumbling say to himselfe,
                     Lord▪ Lord, what a scalde master doe I serue, this it is to serue such Seminary
                     Priests and Iesuits, now euen as I am an honest boy, Ile leaue him in the
                     lurch, and shift for my selfe: here's a doe about penance and mortification, as
                     though (forsooth) Christ hath not died enough for all: The boy mumbled out
                     these his instructions so dissembling, that it strooke a iealousie in the
                     Inne-holders heart, that out of doubt his master was a Seminary Priest;
                     whereupon he presently sent for the Constable, and told him all the foresaid
                     matter, and so went vp both together to attach Tarlton in his chamber, who
                     purposely had shut himselfe close in, and betaken him to his knées, and to his
                     crosses, to make the matter séeme more suspitious, which they espying through
                     the Key-hole, made no more adoe, but in they rushed, and arrested him for a
                     Seminary Priest, discharged his score, bore his, and his boyes charges vp to
                     London, and there in hope to haue rich rewards, presented him to M. Fleetwood,
                     the old Recorder of London: but now marke the Iest; when the Recorder saw
                     Tarlton, and knew him passing well, entertained him very courteously, and all
                     to be foold the Inne-holder and his mate, and sent them away with fleas in
                     their eares: but when Tarlton saw himselfe discharged out of their hands, he
                     stood jesting and pointing at their folly, and so taught them by cunning more
                     wit and thrift against another time.</ab>

                     Out, alas, sayes the mietres, not knowing who it was. Tarlton, hearing it was

                     a glimpse of Tarlton in the darke, who stept into another roome. How now,
                     mistres ? said the maid. Something, said shee, affrighted me ; some man, sure,

                     was a bull calf that I shut into a roome till J oho, our pounder, came to have
                     pounded him for a stray. Had I thought that, saith she, I would have hit him

                     acquaintance saluted. Shee demands whither they went. Tarlton told her, to make
                     merry at Waltham. Sir, saies shee, then let me request your company at my
                     house, at the Christopher, and, for old familiarity, spend your money there.
                     Not unlesse you goe backe, saies Tarlton. We will else goe to the Hound. But
                     she, loth to lose their custome, sent to London by her man, and goes back with
                     them ; who by the way had much mirth, for she was an exceeding merry honest
                     woman, yet would take anything : which Tarlton hearing, as wise as he was,
                     thinking her of his minde, he was deceived : yet he askt her if the biggest bed
                     in her house were able to hold two of their bignesse ; meaning himself and her.
                     Yes, saies she, and tumble up and downe at pleasure. Yea, one upon another,
                     saies Tarlton. And under, to, saies she. Well, to have their custome, she
                     agreed to everything, like a subtill oastesse : and it fell so out that
                     Tarlton, having her in a roome at her house, askt her which of those two beds
                     were big enough for them two. This, said she : therefore, goe to bed,
                     sweet-heart, Ile come to thee. Masse, saies Tarlton, were my bootes off, I
                     would, indeed. Ile help you, sir, saies she, if you please. Yea, thought
                     Tarlton, is the wind in that doore? Come on, then. And she very diligently
                     begins to pull, till one boot was half off. Now, saies she, this being hard to
                     doe, let me try my cunning on the other, and so get off both. But, having both
                     half off his legs, she left. him alone in the shoemakers stocks, and got her to
                     London, where Tarlton was three houres, and had no help. But, being eas'd of
                     his paine, he made this ryme for a theame, singing of it all the way to London

                  <ab>On a Sunday, Tarlton rode to llford, where his father kept; and, dining with
                     them at his sisters, there came in divers of the countrey to see him, amongst
                     whom was one plaine countrey plough-jogger, who said hee was of Tarlton's kin,
                     and so called him cousin. But Tarlton demanded of his father if it were so. But
                     he knew no such matter. Whereupon, saies Tarlton, whether he be of my kin or
                     no, I will be cousin to him ere we part, if all the drinke in Ilford will doe
                     it. So upon this they carouse freely, and the clowne was then in his cue, so
                     that, in briefe, they were both in soundly. Night came, and Tarlton would not
                     let his cousin goe, but they would lye together that night, meaning to drinke
                     at their departure next morning. Tarlton would by wit leave him in the lash,
                     since power would not. But see the jest. That night the plaine fellow so ....
                     Tarlton in his bed, thinking he had been against the church wall, that he was
                     faine to cry for a fresh shirt to shift. him. So, when al was well, they must
                     needs drinke at parting : where, indeed, to seale kindred soundly, the fellow
                     had his loade; for, hearing that his cousin Tarlton was gone to London, Zounds,
                     he would follow, that he would, none could hold him; and, meaning to goe
                     towards London, his aime was so good, that he went towards Rumford to sell his
                     hogs.</ab>

                     next after: but he comes a day after the faire for that. Nay, saies the fellow,
                     but if two Sundayes fall together, Munday then may be the first, and it would
                     shew well too. Yes, saies Tarlton, but if thy nose stood under thy mouth, it
                     would shew better, and be more for thy profit. How for my profit, said the
                     fellow ? Marry, said Tarlton, never to be cold in winter, being so neere every

                     him with this rime:-</ab>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Jack Nag, be brag, and lustie brave it,</l>
                     <l>I have enough for mony, and thou shalt have it.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <ab>But when Jack Nag smelt to them they were so musty that he would none : God
                     thanke you, master : which Tarlton seeing, runnes into the Market, and would
                     slash and cut. But til the next market day the fellow was not to be found, and
                     before then Tarlton must be gone.</ab>

                  <ab>Tarlton in his travaile had a dogge of fine qualities ; amongst the rest, he
                     would carry sixpence in the end of his tongue, of which he would brag often,
                     and say, Never was the like. Yes, saies a lady, mine is more strange, for he
                     will beare a French crowne in his mouth. No, saies Tarlton, I thinke not. Lend
                     me a French crowne, saies the lady, and you shall see. Truly, madame, I have it
                     not, but if your dog will carry a crackt English crowne here it is. But the
                     lady perceived not the jest, but was desirous to see the dogs trick of
                     sixpence. Tarlton threw down a teaster, and said, Bring, sirra, and by fortune
                     the dog took up a counter, and let the money lie. A gentlewoman by, seeing
                     that, askt him how long he would hold it! An houre, saies Tarlton. That is
                     pretty, said the gentlewoman, let's see that. Meane time she tooke up the
                     sixe-pence, and willed him to let them see the money againe ; when he did see
                     it it was a counter, and he made this rime :-</ab>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Alas, alas, how came all this to passe !</l>
                     <l>The world's worse than it was ;</l>
                     <l>For silver turns to brasse.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <ab>I, sayes the lady, and the dog hath made his master an asse. But Tarlton would
                     never trust to his dogs tricks more.</ab>

                  <ab>In the city of Norwich, Tarlton was on a time invited to an hunting, where
                     there was a goodly gentlewoman, that bravely mounted on a blacke horse, rode
                     exceeding well, to the wonder of all the beholders ; and neither hedge nor
                     ditch stood in her way, but Pegasus, her horse, for so may we tearme him for
                     swiftnesse, flew over all, and she sate him as well. When every one returned
                     home, some at supper commended hie hound, others his hawke, and shee above all,
                     her horse. And, said she, I love no living creature so well, at this instant,
                     as my gallant horse. Yes, lady, a man better, saies Tarlton. Indeed no, said
                     shee, not now ; for since my last husband dyed I hate them most, unlesse you
                     can give me medicines to make me love them. Tarlton made this jest instantly
                     :-</ab>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Why, a horse mingeth whay, madam, a man mingeth amber,</l>
                     <l>A horse is for your way, madam, but a man for your chamber.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <ab>Why, a horse mingeth whay, madam, a man mingeth amber, A horse is for your
                     way, madam, but a man for your chamber.</ab>
                  <lg>
                     <l>That a horse is my chiefe opinion now, I deny not,</l>
                     <l>And when a man doth me more good in my chamber I him defie not.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <ab>But till then give me leave to love something. Then something will please you,
                     said Tarlton, I am glad of that, therefore I pray God send you a good thing or
                     none at all.</ab>

                  <ab>Gentlewoman, said Tarlton, and the rest as you sit, I can tell you strange
                     things : now many gallants at supper noted one woman, who being little and
                     pretty, to unfit her prettinesse had a great wide mouth, which she seeming to
                     hide, would pinch in her speeches, and speake small, but .was desirous to heare
                     newes. Tarlton told at his comming from London to Norwich, a proclamation was
                     made that every man should have two wives. Now Jesus, qd. she, is it possible?
                     Ay gentlewoman, and otherwise able too, for contrarily women have a larger
                     preeminence, for every woman must have three husbands. Now Jawsus, said the
                     gentlewoman, and with wonder shewes the full widenesse of her mouth, which all
                     the table smil'd at ; which she perceiving, would answere no more. Now mistris,
                     said Tarlton, your mouth is lease than ever it was, for now it is able to say
                     nothing. Thou art a cogging knave, said she. Masse, and that is something, yet,
                     said Tarlton, your mouth shall be as wide as ever it was for that jest.</ab>

                     Suffolk, that died but of late daies, one M. Blague, by name, and a good kinde
                     justice, too, carefull for the poore : this justice met with Tarlton in Norwich
                     ; Tarlton, said he, give me thy hand. But you, sir, being richer, may give me a
                     greater gift, give me your body, and embracing him, could not halfe compasse
                     him. Being merry in talke, said the justice, Tarlton, tell me one thing, what
                     is the difference betwixt a flea and a louse? Marry, sir, said Tarlton, as much
                     and like difference as twixt you and me : I, like a flea, see else, can skip
                     nimbly, but you, like a fat louse, creepe slowly, and you can go no faster,
                     though butchers are over you, ready to knock you on the head. Thou art a knave,

                     here now, for ever one knave, making a stop, seekes out another. The justice,
                     understanding him, laughed heartily.</ab>
