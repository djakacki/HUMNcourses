                  to Supper, and because he was a man noted, she would not goe with him in the
                  street, but intreats him to kéepe one side and she another, which he consented
                  to: but as he went he would cry out to her and say, Turne that way wife, and
                  anon on this side wife: so the people flockt the more to laugh at them, but his
                  wife more then mad angry, goes backe againe, and almost forswore his
                  company.</ab>

               <head><title>How Tarlton committed a Rakers horse to Ward.</title></head>
               <ab>VVHen Tarlton dwelt in Gracious stréet, at a Tauerne at the signe of the Saba,
                  he was chosen Scauenger: and often the Ward complained of his slacknes in
                  kéeping the stréets cleane: so on a time when the Cart came, he asked the
                  Raker, why he did his businesse so slackly. Sir said he, my fore-horse was in
                  the fault, who being let blood and drencht yesterday, I durst not labour him:
                  sir said Tarlton, your horse shall smart for it, and so leads him to the
                  Counter, which the Raker laught at, and without his horse did his worke with
                  the rest, thinking Tarltons homor was to iest, and would returne him his horse
                  againe anon: but when that anon came, he was faine to pay all his fées of the
                  prison, as directly as if he himselfe had béene there: for if Tarlton had
                  committed the master, the busines had not gone forward, therefore the horse was
                  in prison for the Master.</ab>

                  him.</title></head>
               <ab>TArlton kéeping a Tauerne in Gracious stréet, hee let it to another, who was
                  indebted to Armins Master, a Gold smith in Lumbard stréet: yet he himselfe had
                  a Chamber in the same house. And this Armin being then a wag came often thither
                  to demaund his Masters money, which hee sometimes had, and sometimes had not:
                  in the end the man growing poore, told the boy he had no money for his Master,
                  and he must beare with him. The mans name being Charles, Armin made this verse,
                  writing it with chalke on a waine-scot:</ab>
               <lg>
                  <l>O world how wilt thou lie, is this Charles the great? that I denie:</l>
                  <l>Indeed Charles the great before,</l>
                  <l>But now Charles the lesse, being poore.</l>
               </lg>
               <ab>Tarlton comming into the roome reading it, and partly acquainted with the
                  boyes humor, comming often thither for his M. money, tooke a piece of chalke,
                  &amp; writ this rime by it.</ab>
               <lg>
                  <l>A wag thou art, none can preuent thee,</l>
                  <l>And thy desert shall content thee:</l>
                  <l>Let me diuine, as I am, so in time thou'lt be the same.</l>
                  <l>My adopted sonne therefore be,</l>
                  <l>To enioy my Clownes suite after me.</l>
               </lg>
               <ab>And sée how it fell out: the Boy reading this, so loued Tarlton after, that
                  regarding him with more respect, vsed to his playes, and fell in a league with
                  his humour, and priuate practise brought him to present playing, and at this
                  houre performes the same, where at the Globe on the Bancke-side men may sée
                  him.</ab>
