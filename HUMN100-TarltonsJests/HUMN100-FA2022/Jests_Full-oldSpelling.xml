                  <ab>Gentlewoman, said <persName>Tarlton</persName>, and the rest as you sit, I can tell you strange
                     things : now many <persName>gallants</persName> at supper noted one <persName>woman</persName>, who being <state><desc type="apperance">little</desc></state> and
                     <state><desc type="apperance">pretty</desc></state>, to unfit her prettinesse had a great <trait><desc type="apperance">wide</desc></trait> mouth, which she seeming to
                     hide, would pinch in her speeches, and speake small, but .was desirous to heare
                     newes. <persName>Tarlton</persName> told at his comming from <placeName>London</placeName> to <placeName>Norwich</placeName>, a proclamation was
                     made that every man should have two <persName>wives</persName>. Now <persName>Jesus</persName>, qd. she, is it possible?
                     Ay gentlewoman, and otherwise able too, for contrarily <persName>women</persName> have a larger
                     <state><desc>preeminence</desc></state>, for every <persName>woman</persName> must have three husbands. Now <persName>Jawsus</persName>, said the
                     gentlewoman, and with <state><desc>wonder</desc></state> shewes the full <trait><desc type="apperance">widenesse</desc></trait> of her <objectName>mouth</objectName>, which all
                     the table <state><desc>smil'd</desc></state> at ; which she <state><desc>perceiving</desc></state>, would answere no more. Now <persName>mistris</persName>,
                     said <persName>Tarlton</persName>, your mouth is lease than ever it was, for now it is able to say
                     nothing. Thou art a cogging knave, said she. <persName>Masse</persName>, and that is something, yet,
                     said <persName>Tarlton</persName>, your <objectName>mouth</objectName> shall be as <trait><desc type="apperance">wide</desc></trait> as ever it was for that jest.</ab>
