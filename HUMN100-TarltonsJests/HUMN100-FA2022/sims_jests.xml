                  Ilford.</title></head>
               <ab>On a Sunday, Tarlton rode to llford, where his father kept; and, dining with
                  them at his sisters, there came in divers of the countrey to see him, amongst
                  whom was one plaine countrey plough-jogger, who said hee was of Tarlton's kin,
                  and so called him cousin. But Tarlton demanded of his father if it were so. But
                  he knew no such matter. Whereupon, saies Tarlton, whether he be of my kin or
                  no, I will be cousin to him ere we part, if all the drinke in Ilford will doe
                  it. So upon this they carouse freely, and the clowne was then in his cue, so
                  that, in briefe, they were both in soundly. Night came, and Tarlton would not
                  let his cousin goe, but they would lye together that night, meaning to drinke
                  at their departure next morning. Tarlton would by wit leave him in the lash,
                  since power would not. But see the jest. That night the plaine fellow so ....
                  Tarlton in his bed, thinking he had been against the church wall, that he was
                  faine to cry for a fresh shirt to shift. him. So, when al was well, they must
                  needs drinke at parting : where, indeed, to seale kindred soundly, the fellow
                  had his loade; for, hearing that his cousin Tarlton was gone to London, Zounds,
                  he would follow, that he would, none could hold him; and, meaning to goe
                  towards London, his aime was so good, that he went towards Rumford to sell his
                  hogs.</ab>

               <ab>One asked Tarlton why Munday was called Sundaies fellow! Because he is a
                  sausie fellow, saies Tarlton, to compare with that holy day. But it may be
                  Munday thinkes himselfe Sundayes fellow, because it followes Sunday, and is
                  next after: but he comes a day after the faire for that. Nay, saies the fellow,
                  but if two Sundayes fall together, Munday then may be the first, and it would
                  shew well too. Yes, saies Tarlton, but if thy nose stood under thy mouth, it
                  would shew better, and be more for thy profit. How for my profit, said the
                  fellow ? Marry, said Tarlton, never to be cold in winter, being so neere every
                  dogs taile. The fellow seeing a foolish question had a foolish answere, laid
                  his legges on his neck, and got him gone.</ab>
