               <ab>Upon a time, Tarlton was wrongfully accused for getting of a gentleman's maid
                  with child, and for the same brought before a justice in Kent, which justice
                  said as followeth : It is a mervaile, M. Tarlton, that you, being a gentleman
                  of good qualitie, and one of her majesties servants, would venture thus to get
                  maides with childe. Nay, rather, quoth Tarlton, were it marvell, if a maid had
                  gotten me with child.</ab>

               <ab>Tarlton travelling to play abroad, was in a towne where, in the inne, was a
                  pretty maid, whose favour was placed in a corner of Tsrlton's affection: and
                  talking with her, shee appoynted to meet him at the bottom of a paire of
                  staires. Night and the houre came, and the maid subtily sent downe her
                  mistresse ; whome Tarlton catching in his armes, Art come, wench ? saies hee.
                  Out, alas, sayes the mietres, not knowing who it was. Tarlton, hearing it was
                  the mistris, start aside, and the maid came downe with a candle, and she espyed
                  a glimpse of Tarlton in the darke, who stept into another roome. How now,
                  mistres ? said the maid. Something, said shee, affrighted me ; some man, sure,
                  for I heard him speake. No, no, mistresse, said the maid ; it is no man ; it
                  was a bull calf that I shut into a roome till J oho, our pounder, came to have
                  pounded him for a stray. Had I thought that, saith she, I would have hit him
                  such a knocke on his forehead that his home should never have grac'd his
                  coxcombe ; and so she departs up againe, afraid. But how Tarlton tooke this
                  jest, think you.</ab>

               <ab>In the country, Tarlton told his oastesse he was a conjuror. 0, sir, sayes
                  she, I had pewter stolne off my shelfe the other day; help me to it, and I will
                  forgive you all the pots of ale you owe mee, which is sixteene dozen. Sayes
                  Tarlton, To morrow morning the divell shall helpe you to it, or I will trounce
                  him. Morning came, and the oastesse and he met in a roome by themselves.
                  Tarlton, to passe the time with exercise of his wit, with circles and tricks
                  falls to conjure, having no more skill then a dogge. But see the jest, how
                  contrarily it fell out : as he was calling out, mons, pons, simul, and sons,
                  and such like, a cat, unexpected, leapt from the gutter window ; which sight so
                  amazed Tarlton, that he skipt thence and threw his hostesse downe, so that he
                  departed with his fellowes, and left her hip out of joynt,, being then in the
                  surgeons hands, and not daring to tell how it came.</ab>
