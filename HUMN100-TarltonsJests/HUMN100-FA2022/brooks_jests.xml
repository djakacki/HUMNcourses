               <ab>TArlton being one Sunday at Court all day, caused a payre of Oares to tend
                  him, who at night called on him to be gone: Tarlton being a carousing, drunke
                  so long to the Watermen, that one of them was bumpsie, and so indéed were all
                  thrée for the most part: at last they left Gréenwitch, the Tide being at a
                  great low fall, the Watermen yet affraid of the crosse Cables by the
                  Lime-house: very darke and late as it was, landed Tarlton at Cuckolds-hauen,
                  and said the next day they would giue him a reason for it: But Tarlton was
                  faine to goe by land to Reddriffe on the durty banke, euery step knée déepe: so
                  that comming home, hee called one of his boyes to helpe him off with his boots,
                  meaning his stockings, which were dyed of another colour. Whereupon one gaue
                  him this Theame next day.</ab>
               
               <lg>
                  <l>Tarlton tell me, for faine would I know,</l>
                  <l>If thou wert landed at Culckolds-hauen or no?</l>
               </lg>
               
               <ab>Tarlton answered thus:</ab>
               
               <lg>
                  <l>Yes Sir, and I tak't in no scorne,</l>
                  <l>For many land there, yet misse of the horne.</l>

               <head><title>How Tarlton fought with Blacke Dauie,</title></head>
               <ab>NOt long since liued a little swaggerer, called blacke Dauie, who would at
                  Sword and Buckler fight with any gentleman or other, for 12. pence: he being
                  hired to draw vpon Tarlton, for breaking a iest vpon huffin Kate, a puncke as
                  men tearmed her: one euening Tarlton comming forth at the Court-gate, being at
                  Whitehal, and walking toward the Tilt-yard, this Dauie immediatly drew vpon
                  Tarlton: who on the sudden, though amazed, drew likewise, and inquired the
                  cause, which Dauie denied, till they had fought about or two: Tarlton
                  couragiously got within him, and taking him in his armes, threw him into the
                  Tilt-yard, who falling vpon his nose, broke it extreamely, that euer after he
                  snuffled in the head; poore Dauie lying all that night in the Tilt-yard,
                  expecting the doores to be opened, came forth, and at the Barber▪ surgeons told
                  of this bloody combat, and the occasion of it was (quoth hee) because Tarlton
                  being in a Tauerne in the companie of this damnable Cockatrice huffing Kate,
                  called for wine: but she told him that without he would burne it, she would not
                  drinke. No quoth Tarlton, it shal be burnt, for thou canst burn it without
                  fire: as how sir? (quoth she) marry thus, take the Cup in thine hand &amp; I
                  will tell thée: So he filling the cup in her hand, said it was burnt
                  sufficiently in so fiery a place: she perceiuing her selfe so flouted, hyred me
                  to be her Champion to reuenge her quarrell.</ab>
