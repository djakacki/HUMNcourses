      let them walke a turne or two: or there is a <font xmlns="" color="pink">faire</font><font xmlns="" color="green">Garden</font>, let them play a game or two at
      bowles in the <font xmlns="" color="green">Alley</font>, and departs thence about his other <font xmlns="" color="orange">businesse</font>.
      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> commending the suddaine <font xmlns="" color="orange">wit</font> of the <font xmlns="" color="blue">steward</font>,
      said little: but my <font xmlns="" color="blue">Steward</font> not quiet, tels to the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Gentlewomen</font> aboue, how he had driuen

      louing <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> well, came and told him as much. Tarlton to adde fuell to the fire, and loath
      to rest thus put off with a iest, goes and gets two of the horses into the <font xmlns="" color="green">Garden</font>, and turns them into the
      <font xmlns="" color="green">Bowling Alley</font>, who with their <font xmlns="" color="orange">héeles</font> made <font xmlns="" color="orange">hauocke</font>,

      Fellow, what meanest thou? nothing Sir, saies he, but two of my horses are at seuen
      vp, for a pecke of
      <font xmlns="" color="orange">Prouender</font>, a foolish match that I made: now they being in play at bowles, run, run: your <font xmlns="" color="blue">steward</font>
      may come after and crie rub, rub: at which, though they smiled, yet the <font xmlns="" color="blue">steward</font> had no thankes for his
      <font xmlns="" color="orange">labour</font>, to set the horses to such an exercise: and they could not blame <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font>, who did

      they conuaied him to the Iayle on a mans <font xmlns="" color="orange">backe</font>, and intreated the Iayler to doe

      <font xmlns="" color="blue">Tarlton</font> and others, intreating the <font xmlns="" color="blue">Kéeper</font>, yet if it might be, that they might
      sée their fellow ere they went, but hee very hardly was intreated, but at

      <font xmlns="" color="blue">God</font>, O <font xmlns="" color="blue">God</font> saies the fellow, is my fault so great? then commend me to all my

      an escape, and sent him to <font xmlns="" color="green">London</font> before, who was not a litle glad he was gone:
      but sée how this Iest wrought, by little and little the fellow left his
